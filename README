At the beginning, the purpose of this repository was exclusively to be
a place where a put templates to use with LaTeX, or XeLaTeX.

But this purpose changed, I have now several targets with this
repository, and that's why I didn't give a practical name to my repository.

In this repo I will put some files that I use as templates when
writing a report, long files, or articles with LaTeX (or XeLaTeX).

Also, I will push my configuration files for emacs (and particularly
my init.el) and for vim.

In you are interested, I have a blog where I put some tips, help for beginners :
