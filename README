At the beginning, the purpose of this repository was exclusively to be
a place where I put templates to use with LaTeX, or XeLaTeX.

But this purpose changed, I have now several targets with this
repository, and that's why I didn't give a practical name to my
repository. It is much more like a common place where I will gather
all files that I consider to be useful for anyone else.

I will put here some files that I use as templates for LaTeX (or XeLaTeX) to
write a report, long files, articles, slides, etc.

I will put also my configuration files for emacs and for vim which are
relevant (.init.el, .vimrc, etc).

In case you are interested, I have a blog where I put some tips, help
for beginners :
