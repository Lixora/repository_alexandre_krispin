Here are the directories where my configuration for emacs and vim are located.
Both are really good text editor, but according to me Vim has really amazing
features that emacs don't have.

If you plan to use LaTeX like the average users seems to do, then use emacs.
AucTeX has a preview mode, that some users like. But if you prefer to get a
really good autocompletion, use Vim.

Also, if you don't want to bother with shortcuts like Ctrl+x ctrl+s, ctrl+x
ctrl+c for example, then use Vim. It use simple keys to do all the stuff you
will need to typeset files in LaTeX.

Vim could be quit weird at the beginning, but it is matter of habit. For this
reason, if you would like to improve your efficiency, I would recommend to use
GVim, and learn to like its shortcuts.

I will describe on my blog some basic features, so if you are interested, look
