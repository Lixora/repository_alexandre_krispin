The purpose of this post is to explain my setup for GNU/Emacs that I
use to write files compiled with XeLaTeX. Some people use Kile, some
others use TeXmaker, a few others gedit and its plugin, and so
on. Some others use Emacs or (G)Vim, two famous text editor. Choosing
one those might depend on your habit. Also, notice that if you want
the best auto-completion, then don't use Emacs, use (G)Vim.

Interestingly, if you are European or American, then you might be
willing to choose a so-called "easy" to use TeX editor like TeXworks
or Kile. Whereas if you are African, you might try Emacs. This doesn't
mean that European or American are not civilized or less clever than
African, but that bad habit are unfortunately difficult to change. If
you want to get a try to emacs, then follow the following steps.
<ol>
	<li>If you plan to use Emacs, since I had problem with Ubuntu
	10.04, don't install it from you package manager, but from the
	official website. The download link is the following :

<a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/">choose emacs-23.2.tar.bz2</a>

If you are not familiar with Unix command, then save your emacs
version in you home (/home/username/). To install it, you will have to
use the terminal (press alt+F2 and enter gnome-terminal in the
prompt). Then, enter the following commands :
<blockquote>cd ~
tar xjvf emacs-23.2.tar.bz2
cd emacs-23.2
./configure
make
sudo make install</blockquote>
The installation will take some time to process.
</li>

<li>After the installation is complete, install yasnippet, in the
  following link :
  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/yasnippet/downloads/list">download
  yasnippet-0.6.1c.tar.bz2</a> 

Then, extract the files, and copy them in a folder ".emacs.d", in
  your home. In .emacs.d, create an othe folder, called lisp. In this
  folder, copy yasnippet.el and dropdown-list.el. Finally, copy the
  snippet folder in your .emacs.d folder.

Notice that if you don't have an .emacs.d folder, you have to create
  it. If you don't know how to see hidden folders, then press ctrl+h,
  and you will see them. And if this keystroke doesn't work, see in
  the menu bar of your file manager an option to show hidden files and
  folders (for the file manager of kde it might be something like
  "alt+.").

</li>Now download color themes for emacs :
<a href="http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/color-theme/">choose
  to download color-theme-6.6.0.tar.gz</a>

Once you get it, expand it and copy the color-theme-6.6.0 folder in
your .emacs.d folder.
</li>

<li>An other tool for Emacs which might be important if you plan to
  use graphics is the gnuplot-mode. If you don't plan to use graphics
  with LaTeX, skip this point. To download gnuplot-mode, click here :
<a href="http://cars9.uchicago.edu/~ravel/software/gnuplot-mode/gnuplot-mode.0.6.0.tar.gz">gnuplot-mode.0.6.0.tar.gz</a>
Once you get it, expand the folder in you home, and in a terminal, do
the following :
<<code>
   cd ~
cd gnuplot-mode.0.6.0
./configure
make
cp *.elc ~/.emacs.d/lisp/
   </code>>
Now Gnuplot-mode is installed, we will see later for the configuration.
</li>

</ol>
