  \chapter{The Disintegration of the old regime}

  The peasant were the source of the major part of the revenue
  received by the Shogun and the \emph{daimyo}. The annual land tax
  formed the most important payment. This varied widely from province
  to province and was altered frequently at the will of the lord. It
  was paid in rice, and it usually amounted to between 40 and 50 per
  cent of the total yield of the pady-fields. In addition, other
  payments in kind and service were exacted from the
  peasants. Japanese writers are at one in declaring that this tribute
  reduced the peasants to a condition of extreme indigence
  \textemdash\ their lot was so hard that they appeared to exist
  solely for the purpose of paying taxes; but whether they were worse
  off than the European peasant of the eighteenth century is a
  question that has not yet been answered, and is probably
  unanswerable.

  The crafts were controlled by guilds which bore a fairly close
  resemblance to the European craft guilds. The guilds regulated
  prices and conditions of production, sale and
  apprenticeship. Membership was limited and hereditary, and it could
  be acquired by a newcomer only through the purchase of the
  \emph{kabu} (membership-privilege) from a retiring member. The
  guilds which had been recognized by the central government in the
  Trade Association Decree of 1721, paid taxes to the Shogunate or the
  \emph{daimyo}, and the names of members were registered with the
  authorities.

  Industrial activity was by no means limited to the guilds. As
  already shown, a form of domestic system was widespread in Tokugawa
  times. Articles manufactured by peasant families and urban workers
  were bought by merchants and distributed in the chief consuming
  centres. Sometimes the merchants made advances of raw materials and
  equipment to the producers, and in trades in which the operations
  were numerous and complex they assumed the responsibility for
  dividing the work in its various stages among the producers.

  The Economic causes of the change were of profound, perhaps of
  pre-eminent importance. Prince Matsukata, the great financial
  administrator of the Meiji era, was one of the most notable of the
  public men in new Japan to emphasize these causes, and recent
  investigations bring out clearly the economic disintegration that
  had been taking place for many years before 1867. It is evident that
  from the early years of the nineteenth century, and indeed before
  this, the Tokugawa régime was being shaken by serious financial
  difficulties and by changes in the social and economic structure of
  the country which were the source of widespread discontent.

  Let us examine the financial position of the central Government. The
  first of the Tokugawa Shoguns, Iyeyasu (1603-16), had accumulated a
  large reserve of trasure, chiefly through seizing the property of
  \emph{daimy\={o}} who had been hostile to him; but this was
  dissipated during the second half of the seventeenth century, partly
  through rising of administrative expenses and partly through
  numerous earthquakes and fires which devasted Yedo. In the next
  century efforts to maintain financial stability were successfull
  only for short intervals. Apart from his rice-revenues, the Shogun
  derived an income from taxes imposed on traders resident in the
  ports and large towns, which were mainly under his control, and rom
  mining properties operated by the central Government.  The
  restrictions on foreign trade meant that only a meagre income was
  available from importe or export duties. So the Shogun had not at
  his command a source of revenue which rulers in Europe had found
  increasingly important as the income from their domains became
  insufficient to meet the growing expenses of government during the
  same period. Financial administration was lax, and owing to the
  corruption of officials, a considerable parts of the proceeds of the
  taxes failed to find its way into the Treasury. Attemps to wrest
  higher taxes from the peasantry led to frequent jacqueries and to a
  tendency for the farmers to desert the land for the towns, a
  movement which struck at the whole basis of the revenue and which
  official prohibition seems to have done little to check.  From the
  latter part of the eighteenth century, moreover, the country was
  visited by a series of natural disasters, including earthquakes and
  famines.

  To meet his growing difficulties, the Shogun did not hesitate to
  resort to the traditional expedient of governments in financial
  distress. The currency suffered successive debasements so that the
  purchasing power of the standard coin by the middle of the
  nineteenth century was only one-eigth of its purchasing power in
  1661. The rise in prices which debasement caused provoked great
  discontent among the classes injured by it, and the trouble was
  accentuated as a result of the issue by the \emph{daimyo}, for the
  purpose of meeting their own financial difficulties, not merely of
  illegal coinage, but also of large quantities of notes secured
  against stock of rice and other consumable goods, including even
  umbrellas.

  Meanwhile, feudal society in the provinces was breaking up. Attempts
  were made to reduce expenses by cutting down the \emph{samurai's}
  allowances with the result that the lower strata in this class
  became impoverished. In the search for additional revenue, the
  \emph{daimyo} increased their issues of paper money, which tended
  further to disorganize the economic life of their \emph{han}, and
  they also established various industrial and trading enterprises of
  a monopolistic kind, a policy which helped to modify the character
  of the feudal society. After the middle of the eighteenth century
  the \emph{daimyo} resorted increasingly to loans. These were secured
  on their rice revenues, and they were raised from the merchants who
  acted as the \emph{daimyo's} agent for selling their rice. The
  result was that the merchant classes increased in wealth and
  influence.

  Since the \emph{samurai} were paid their incomes in a commodity
  liable to violent fluctuations in price, their economic position
  became increasingly unstable as a resut of the spread of a money
  economy in the towns where they lived for much of their time. Many
  of them were even obliged to sell or pawn their swords and armour,
  the insignia of their privileged rank, and to engage in occupations
  traditionally despised. They often entered the service of merchants,
  or set up in trade on their own.

  During the last few decades of the Shogunate, and especially after
  the opening of the ports to foreigners, the central Government seems
  to have accepted the proposition that fundamental changes were
  required in administration and economic policy. At all events, it
  began to introduce a series of reforms which the Meiji Government
  later carried through.

  The Shogun also attempted to deal with the rise in prices, which was
  causing unrest in the early decades of the nineteenth century. This
  rise in prices was commonly attributed at the time to the activities
  of the guilds. These organizations were pursuing an increasingly
  exclusive policy. In consequence, there was a considerable growth in
  the number of journeymen (\emph{shokunin}) who, though qualified by
  apprenticeship for the status of master craftsmen, were not admitted
  to full membership of the guilds. Disputes between the
  \emph{shokunin} and the guilds were frequent, and the latter found
  increasing difficulty in maintaining their monopoli rights over
  trade. [\ldots] The monopolistic practices of the guilds had already
  been challenged in the provinces by the tendency of the local
  governments to set up their own manufacturing and trading
  organizations in order to improve their financial position.

  A blow was given to the merchants' privileges by the decrees of 1831
  and 1843 which abolished all forms of guild. The immediate result of
  this step, however, was to disorganize economic life still further;
  for the abolition of the guilds involved the destruction of the
  credit system that rested on the \emph{kabu}, or membership
  privilege.

  The effect of the impact of the outside world was especially obvious
  in the relative prices of the period 1859-67. There was an enormous
  rise in the price of raw silk, egg cards, rice, tea and, in general,
  articles for which a foreign demand became keen. On the other hand,
  imports of cheap cotton textiles, yarn and other products ofr
  machine industry brought about a steep fall in the price of such
  goods. Naturally these changes caused economic dislocation.

  It was not among the \emph{chonin} that the leadership needed to
  usher in the new world was mainly found. Some of them, notably
  Mitsui, helped to finance the revolt against Tokugawa. But, as a
  class, the \emph{chonin} owed their wealth to their position as
  financial and commercial agents of the \emph{daimyo} and Shogun; the
  interests of most of them were bound up with the old régime, even
  though they might sometimes suffer from its exactions. Insulaed by
  the Seclusion Edict from the vitalizing impact of foreign trade,
  they had become as a class conservative in temper and restrictionist
  in commercial policy. [\ldots] It was the \emph{samurai} of lower
  rank from \textquotedblleft outside\textquotedblright\ clans who
  initiated the revolt and played the major rôle in weaving both the
  policital and the economic fabric of New Japan. This class, during
  the Tokugawa period, had become increasingly impoverished, and their
  social privileges had been curtailed as a result of their economic
  distress. Far from having any stake in the old régime, their
  interests lay entirely in the direction of change.

  \chapter{Reconstruction, 1868-81}

  \section{General economic changes}

  It is not to be thought that strategy and difficulties with the
  balance of payments provided the only motives for the Government's
  policy of sponsoring industry. Another reason was to find employment
  for the \emph{samurai}. These had not only lost their privileged
  status but also, as a result of the commutation of their pensions,
  had suffered grievous financial loss. They were not a submissive
  class like the peasants and, if their smouldering discontent were to
  be blown into flames the Restoration Government might well be
  consumed.  To find them remunerative occupations was, therefore, a
  condition of the Government's survival.

  The new communications, especially railways and steamships played an
  indispensable part in promoting economic growth. Markets were
  enlarged and local specialization encouraged. Prince Matsukata was
  certainly righ in suggesting, with an eye on his own country's
  needs, that there was a high correlation between railway development
  and general economic progress in the various parts of the
  world. Yet, it is probable that mechanized transport, at any rate in
  the early years of Meiji, was less significant for Japan than
  innovations that were technically quite primitive [for example
  replacement of packhorses and human porters by rickshaws and carts
  pulled by horses].

  This progress, however, was not evenly spread; for certain groups of
  producers who had already been injured by the opening of the country
  to foreign trade, suffered further injury through the abolition of
  feudal institutions.  \textquotedblleft A vast number of occupations
  which had hitherto been thriving had suddenly to be abandonned, and
  skilled labourers and artisans were thrown out of employment in
  thousands. Moreover, all kinds of monopolies and business privileges
  which the \emph{daimyo} granted to their favourite merchants and to
  themselves ceased to exist with the fall of
  feudalism.\textquotedblright\. When the Shogun gave up his residence
  at Yedo (Tokyo), this meant the withdrawal of and enormous number of
  retainers, both his own and those of the \emph{daimyo}.  The
  economic life of the town was for a time paralysed by this loss of a
  large consuming class. Similarly, when feudalism was abolished, the
  Osaka merchants whose business had been to sell the rice crops sent
  to that city by the \emph{daimyo} lost their chief function. In the
  provinces industrial lie had formerly centred round the castle
  towns.

  The composition of the foreign trade was typical of a country in
  Japan's stage of development. The bulk of the imports consisted of
  manufactured goods, of which textiles, particularly cotton, formed
  by the most important group of commodities. The import of cheap
  Manchester goods rose very rapidly in the early seventies and
  displaced many of the domestic fabrics formerly produced in the
  homes of the people. Other fairly important items consisted of
  capital goods, such as machinery, ships, railway equipment,
  munitions, and other manufactured metal products.

  \section{Financial problems}

  In 1868 the new Government found itself faced by grave budgetary
  difficulties.  Because of the cost incurred in crushing the clans
  hostile to the Imperial régime, public expenditure was heavy, while
  revenue was difficult to obtain. The whole of the revenue which the
  Shogun drew from his own domain and on which that ruler had mainly
  relied for meeting his administrative expenses was not yet available
  for the Meiji Government, and the local governments still preserved
  financial autonomy; The cahotic state of the country made it
  difficult for the Government to impose new taxes, and agreements
  with foreign Powers strictly limited the amount that could be
  secured from custom duties. [\ldots] In these circumstances the
  Government was obliged to resort to the printing press [\ldots] The
  issue was resented by the \emph{daimyo} who feared the effect of the
  Government notes on their own paper money, and the general distrust
  of the Government's position led to a heavy depreciation in their
  value. At one time during 1868 the notes exchanged for specie at a
  discount of 55 per cent. The currency situation was, indeed,
  alarming; for the monetary circulation comprised not merely these
  new issues of inconvertible notes, but also gold and silver coins in
  varying degrees of debasement \textemdash\ an inheritance from the
  Shogunate \textemdash\ and about 1,500 varieties of clan notes.

  The force hostile to meiji had been finally crushed by the end of
  1869. In consequence the Government's expenses diminished, and in
  1870 there was no considerable rise in the note issue. The cessation
  of inflation, together with the increasing confidence in the new
  régime, was responsible for an appreciation in the value of the
  notes which, the Government had announced, were to be redeemed in
  1873.

  Although by 1876 these reforms in taxation had not yet yielded their
  fruits, the fiscal position at that time was by no means
  unsatisfactory, especially in view of the difficulties with which
  the Government had been confronted. A large part of its liabilities
  was an inheritance from the Shogunate, and its period of office had
  been one in which it had been engaged in suppressing rebellion and
  in transforming the administrative life of the country. Some of its
  debts were covered by valuable assets, such as a railway and several
  industrial and commercial undertakings.

  In 1877 the hereditary pensions of the privileged classes were
  commuted for public bonds. \textquotedblleft Now this class, beyond
  the functions which had appertained to it under the régime which
  had passed away, was ignorant of the ordinary means of gaining a
  livelihood, and now being suddenly released from these functions,
  was greatly in danger of falling into a state of indigence and
  perhaps into pauperism, nless some calling could be found for its
  members.

  Formed by men without business experience, they [the banks] were in
  general badly managed, and most of the real banking business of the
  country was counducted either by foreign banks or by those native
  institutions which had been established by the mercantile class
  before the amended regulations of 1876.  The large note issues made
  by the banks, however, contributed substantially to the inflationary
  movement which began with the Government's own issue of 27 million
  yen of paper money in 1877. [\ldots] The greater part of this
  increase [the increase of Government and bank notes] had, of course,
  been occasioned by the pension bond issue and by the loan from the
  Fifteenth Bank.

  All the symptoms of a violent inflation now showed
  themselves. General prices rose rapidly, and the price of rice, by
  far the most important commodity, was doubled between 1877 and
  1880. Specie left the country. The rate of interest rose and
  Government bonds fell in price.

  The Government was not ignorant of the dangers of this inflationary
  boom. The cost of living was steadily rising, and the exchange
  fluctuations made foreign trading exceptionally hazardous.

  The three main features in the history of Japanese public finances
  during the twenty years before the First World War were, first, the
  large increase in annual expenditure, secondly the growth of the
  national debt, and thirdly, the large import of foreign
  capital. These were the necessary consequence of Japan's policy of
  developing her resources in the interests of national power; for the
  increased expenditure and borrowing wre incurred mainly in
  connection with war, armaments, colonial exploitation and the
  establishment of industries of \textquotedblleft national
  importance\textquotedblright.

  The deliberate contraction of the currency during the early eighties
  was naturally accompanied by a fall in prices, including the price
  of rice. While this raised the real revenue from the land tax, it
  imposed additional burdens on the agricultural community, for more
  rice had to be sold to meet the tax demands. In consequence, many of
  the small peasant proprietors at this time were forced to sell their
  land and there was an increase in the proportion of arable land held
  in tenancies. In other words, the result was to bring about some
  concentration of land ownership.

  banking principle of Matsukata : a healthy financial system require
  the existence of banks with specialized functions, which he defined
  as the provision of long-term investment in industry and
  agriculture, the mobilization of the savings of the poorer classes,
  the handling of foreign exchange transactions and the conduct of
  domestic commercial business.

  \chapter{Agriculture, raw silk and textile industries}

  Large-scale enterprise had scarcely touched the basic activities of
  Japan during this era of change. New technical methods were
  introduced, but they were accommodated within the scope of
  small-scale undertakings, and only through the growing magnitude and
  complexity of financial relations between producers and merchants
  had modern capitalism begun to penetrate into these ancient
  industries. It was otherwise with cotton manufacture. There the
  modernizing influences were exerted later than in the silk trade,
  but when they once made themselves felt they soon effected a
  thorough-going transformation. In the early years of Meiji there
  were few signs of the changes that were to come. The first result of
  European contact was to create serious competition within the
  domestic cotton-spinning industry through the import of yarns finer
  and cheaper than those produced in the home. The volume of cotton
  yarn imported rose from 12,000 bales in 1868 to 158,000 bales in
  1888, the peak year.

  The textile trades are of interest for reasons other than their
  size. Although Government initiative had been an important factor in
  their development during the early years of Meiji, and although
  improvements, in the silk industry especially, owed much to official
  regulation, yet on the whole the expansion of these trades in the
  new century had depended little either on direct assistance from the
  Government or on the national economic policy then being worked
  out. Their rise was the natural consequence of the redistribution of
  productive resources that resulted from the impact of Western trade
  and technique on the old Japanese economy.

  Viewed from another standpoint, the textile trades represent a form
  of activities where the two major sections of the Japanese economy
  meet, the traditional peasant economy and the new capitalistic
  economy.

  \chapter{The heavy industries, shipping and foreign trade,
    1881-1914}

\section{Metal, mining and engineering}

When the [metallurgical] industry began to appear in its modern form,
it owed its rise to Government initiative, and for a long time its
very existence depended on hep from the State. It was in fact typical
of those large-scale industries which were called into being by the
Government's policy of building up manufacturing resources necessary
for national power and security. Political necessity rather than
economic advantage supplied the impulse.

The engineering industry, although fostered by the Government for
political reasons, failed to reach a substantial size during this
period. Japan relied until the very last years of Meiji mainly upon
foreign shipyards to provide her with the larger ships for her growing
mercantile marine.

By the standards of the leading Western countries the shipbuilding
output in 1914 was still unimpressive, and this was true of the
production of engineering goods as a whole. The greater part of the
equipment needed for the railways, ships, factories, power stations
and mines was imported, and the production of engineering goods was
limited to a very few factories.
