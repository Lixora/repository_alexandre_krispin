\maketitle

\section{Economic recovery under Takahashi Korekiyo}
p. 55 : Takahashi [Korekiyo], wrote a short magazine article critical
of Inoue's fiscal policies. The article anticipates some elements of
Keynes' \emph{General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money},
published in 1936, so it is invariably cited in discussions of
Takahashi.

First, Takahashi observed that despite the calls for retrenchment in
conjunction with the return to the gold standard, it is necessary to
distinguish between the economy of the nation and the economy of the
individual. For example, let us assume that a person has \textyen
50,000 in hands but only spends \textyen 30,000 and saves the
remaining \textyen 20,000. From the viewpoint of that individual, his
savings have increased and he is better of, but from the viewpoint of
the national economy, domestic demand that should have been at
\textyen 50,000 is down to \textyen 30,000. Since national output will
decrease by that much, the nation is not better of. Conversely,
spending money at geisha houses, while morally reprehensible,
generates income for the cooks and the geisha and a host of other
persons. The cooks and geisha then buy food and use public bathhouses,
so that the money circulates as income for others. Spending even
\textyen 2,000 may thus have an impact on the economy by a factor of
20 or 30.

Thus, says Takahashi, when one considers the national economy, it is
better for everyone if those who have the money use it. Inoue's
policies had cut back government spending and put a stop to
construction of the Diet Building. But then the construction
companies, the laborers who worked for them, and the suppliers of
building materials and everyone else involved lost income and jobs.
[...] The text [...] anticipates Keynes' theory of the investment
multiplier.

p. 56-58 : A falling exchange rate means that
for other countries Japanese goods become cheaper. Lower prices mean
more exports. For Japan, it means that foreign products become more
expensive. Whereas it had been possible to buy one dollar's worth of
foreign goods for \textyen 2, now it took \textyen 3.5 to buy the same
amount of goods. In other words, the goods were more expensive. This
makes conditions easier for importe substitution industries.

On the down side, the following can be said. If Japanese goods sell
cheaply and foreign goods are expensive, it means that the terms of
trade \textemdash~the rate of exchange of Japanese and foreign
products~\textemdash~are to Japan's disadvantage. To make this more
comprehensible, assume that this pen that I am holding is an imported
item and that it cost me \textdollar 1. Assume also that this
publication that I am holding is a Japanese product and costs \textyen
2. If the exchange rate is \textdollar 1.00 = \textyen 2.00, then I
can trade the book for the pen. If the exchange rate falls to, say,
\textdollar 1.00 = \textyen 4.00, then I need two books before I can
do business. The cheap exchange rate leaves me at disadvantage.

Even though the terms of trade are not advantageous, what Japanese
firms ultimately want to earn is yen. If companies are able to export
more and so bring in more yen, the domestic economy is stimulated and
they are able to pull themselves out of the recession. A low exchange
rate has its drawbacks, but it also has a stimulating effect on
exporting industries. inside the country.

Sur la relation entre le taux d'int\'er\^et bas et la liquidit\'e :

The second pillar of Takahashi's economic program was low interest
rates. [...] When interest rates go down, business proprietors who
borrow money find their lives easier.

Lower interest rates also push up the stock market.

When stock prices rise, not only do investors make money, it also
becomes easier for companies to augment their equity capital.
Stockholders are happy to approve share increases, since they obtain
stock at below-market prices, and companies are able to round up the
funds they need to finance and expansion.

Since the primary objective of these programs was less the
construction projetcts themselves than the dispensing of cash to rural
communities, it appears that the construction work had little impact.


\section{Processing trade}

\section{Material mobilization plan}

p. 97 Okumura Kiwao of the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs then drew
up a proposal to the effect that in order to cap excessive
competition and eliminate waste, the entire country's electric power
industry had to be controlled.

p. 97-98 : [vers 1941] state control of industry rapidly progressed.
The base for production activities was import capacity, but when this
was controlled, exports didn't do well, so imports would be cut.

p. 98-100 : Government controls continued to expand in scope. Let us
consider the mechanism involved. When supplies of goods fell short,
their prices naturally went up. This created the fear of inflation, so
the government would set an official price to cap prices. Merchants
and dealers would take counter steps. Since the official price was
routinely less than the market price, the merchants squirreled away
their merchandise and sold it by the back door on the black market.
Producers stopped making products, as they could not break even at the
official price, and they started looking around for other products
that did not yet have an official price tag. For example, let us
assume that white shirts had an official price, but striped shirts did
not. Naturally, manufacturers would make nothing but striped shirts.
But then there weren't any white shirts available, so the government
would be forced to set an official price for striped shirts.

In fact, the government had originally intended to limit officla
prices only to major items, but the mechanism I have just described
compelled it to extend price caps to merchandise every kind. As the
scope of official prices expanded, black market dealings flourished An
economic police was established to clamp down on the black market, and
big and small merchants alike were arrested for illegal transactions.

p. 100-101 : price control legislation was once again introduced
following the 1973 oil crisis. Shiina Etsusaburo, then vice president
of the Liberal Democratic Party, who had been in the Ministry of
Industry and Commerce during the war, is said to have remarked that if
price controls began it would be necessary to set a price on
everything right down to plant pots. I am entirely in agreements with
Mr. Shiina here. If the government attempts to set prices that should
be determined by supply and demand in the marketplace, there will
inevitably be distortions. In the socialist countries, this is an
issue that is constantly debated. The liberalization that has taken
place in Hungary and more recently in China is a manifestation of the
efforts to do away with these distortions.

\subsection{Effects on living standards}

The second event occured in autumn 1939. Western Japan was visited by
drought, as a result of which power shortages occurred and the rice
harvest in western Japon and in Korea was poor. Although the rice
harvest was not seriously below par, the public believed otherwise,
and there was near panic. At one point toward the end of the year,
there was only half a day's supply stock of rice in the rice shops in
Tokyo, and the government feared riots. The government was forced to
buy rice from Thailand and French Indochina, now Vietnam, by the use
of several expedient financial devices.

(...) In the end, everyday necessities \textemdash~including rice,
sugar, miso, and soy sauce \textemdash~became rationed, and ration
coupons were issued to the public. In 1941, the Foodstuff Control
Special Account was set up, under which the government bought up all
the rice produced and distributed it, the rationed rice being mixed
with foreign rice.

\subsection{The new economic order}

One contentious issue at this point centered on why armaments
production did not grow as much as the government had anticipated. The
dominant view was that this pointed to the need for further
socialization of industry and government planning. Rooted in critiques
of the capitalist system, the argument went along the following lines.
Companies operate with the goal of generating a profit. The reason
that armaments output does not improve is that companies still think
first in terms of profit, despite the national crisis. The nature of
the corporation has to be changed so that the goal of its activities
is production rather than profit.

The way in which firms operated on the basis of the profit principle
had to be fundamentally changed and all obstacles to production
capacity eliminated. It was the responsibility of corporate leaders to
open their books for inspection and to permit government control of
their profits and to raise output. The free-market economy aspects of
capitalism had to be eliminated by controlling companies' financial
affairs and profits and by turning companies into organizations
motivated by production rather than profit. Ryu proposed that the
reformed corporations take part in regional and industrial cartels,
which would take responsibility for implementing economic controls.
Since the cartels would not need to consider individual member's
profits, controls would have their objectives undiluted by other
concerns. Japan should switch from external controls, imposed from
above, to internal controls, imposed from below.

p. 104 : Cartels known as control associations (\emph{toseikai}) were
to be set up to impose economic controls on individual industries in
conformity with government policies.

\section{The pacific war}

p. 112 : [Vers 1942] Japan began a rush into Southeast Asia. Big
companies moved into the occupied territories to begin resource
development. Oil drilling equipment, technicians, and workers were
brought from the oil fields in Niigata and Akita to Sumatra, where they
were set to the task of restarting oil production. In Malaya, the
Philippines, and elsewhere, Japanese mining companies began ore
extraction at the command of the military. No attempt was made to set
up control companies or engage in planning, existing companies being
assigned to development in an effort to obtain oil, nickel ore, copper
ore, bauxite, chrome ore, and manganese ore.

\subsection{The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere}

At the beginning of the war, it was known that Japan would not be able
to sustain the living standards of the local peoples. One document
written just before the war was quite explicit that \textquotedblleft~in
the interim, it will be necessary to adopt an exploitative
policy\textquotedblright. During the Sino-Japanese war, there had been a
major flood in northern China, resulting in food shortages. Nonetheless,
the local army prioritized the transportation of coal and cut the number
of trains supplying food. Riots broke out in Chinese cities, and
inflation soared dangerously, forcing the Japanese government in 1940 to
send shipments of flour and cotton goods to stabilize local
economies. But when the Pacific War came, it was no longer possible to
supply the local peoples with their necessities of life. Local
self-sufficiency was the rule, and even if there were real shortages,
Japan lacked the spare resources to make up the gap. All it could do was
issue military scrip.

The local currencies were printed in Japan and issued as military scrip.
Since there was nothing to back these currency issues, inflation was
inevitable. The further a region was from Japan, the harder it was to
ensure the supply of goods and the worse inflation was.

\subsection{Production capacity and skilled workers}

p. 124 : the economic process during the war became the direct starting point
for the postwar economy. The war bequeathed postwar Japan a number of things,
one of which was production capacity. The need to produce armaments during the
war and the output-boosting plans and so on that were demanded by the military
had compelled heavy industries and chemical industries to increase their plant
and equipment. Much of this remained at the end of the war. To cite one
example, steel production capactiy had stood at 3 million tons in 1937 and at
the wartime peak had risen to 6.6 million tons. At the end of the war, 5.6
million tons in capacity remained. Copper refining, lead, and aluminium saw
major capacity expansions, even after subtracting war damage.

\subsection{Institutional continuity into the postwar era}

Another legacy relates to the organizational structure of industry. In the
fields of machinery, aircraft, and automobiles, firms had developed the
practice of contracting work. Most of those doing the contracting were, of
course, big firms, which would do the final assembly, while the subcontracting
factories would make the raw materials and components.

Japan is internationally famous for its \textquotedblleft administrative
guidance\textquotedblright, in which government offices had the power, directly
and indirectly, to instruct businesses on various issues. The prototype of this
system developed during the wartime period. It was also during the war that the
Bank of Japan began to exert strong control over private-sector banking. The
fact that the banks had little fundin capacity after the war helped ensure that
the Bank of Japan remained firmly in control.

\subsection{Separation of ownership and management}

Finally,I would like to mention that the old-fashioned capitalism that I
referred to at the beginning of this similar series was gradually dismantled
during the course of the war. I mentioned earlier the business community's
vehement opposition to proposals to separate ownership from management when the
new economic order was proposed, but as a result of the war, something close to
separation of ownership and management was achieved. To meet the huge military
demand, companies had continued to expand. But even the biggest capitalists
could not cover the costs out of their own pockets. They had to increase
equity, bringing in funds from ordinary stockholders and borrowing from
financial institutions.

\section{Reconstruction (1945-1951)}

\subsection{The Occupation Revolution}

p. 135 : The next objective was economic reform designed  to strip
Japan of its war potential. Armaments manufacturers were, of course,
banned, as were any other industries that contributed to Japan's
military effort. In practice, however, defining what constitutes
materials for military use is not easy: steel, for example, is
fundamental to arms production, but it has a broad range of peaceful uses.

p. 136 : It is not surprising [...] that SCAP proposed reparations on
a large scale. But the reparations proposals came as a major shock to
Japanese industry. It is hard to commit to rebuilding if one might
have one's equipment carted off at any moment. For nearly two years,
Japanese industry was on tenterhooks.

[It is interesting to point out that there might be a democratization
process, but without people, just SCAP] The most important reform of
all was that of the constitution. It is now well known that
Matsumoto's draft was too insipid, and so SCAP's  Government Section
put together a draft of its own, translated it into Japanese, and
instructed the Japanese government to adopt it.

\subsection{Dissolution of the zaibatsu}

In Norman's view,which was closed to that of a Japanese academic
Marxist group known as the \emph{Koza} faction, the Japanese zaibatsu,
being primarily family concerns in which a single family ownedthe
stocks of the parent holding company, were a feudalistic organizations
par excellence. Since they had immense power over a wide spectrum of
business and industry, their dissolution was imperative if
democratization was to succeed.
