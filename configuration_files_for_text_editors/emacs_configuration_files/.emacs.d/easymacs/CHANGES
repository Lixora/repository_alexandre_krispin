1.0 First public release.

1.1 Thought better of binding F10; load tex-mik on W32.

1.2 Fixed bug when INFOPATH set.

1.3 Synced with TEI P5 version 0.1.9.  Split tei-html-docs.el into a
    separate version for p4 and p5, since they are treated differently
    now.  Added new TEI template documents.

1.4 (not released) Added support for Aquamacs (Emacs CVS binary for
    Mac OS X). Fixed bug with 0 and . on numeric keypad and a small
    bug with flyspell-babel.el

1.5 Deprecated Aquamacs in favor of Carbon Emacs Package, mainly on
    the grounds that it includes aspell.  Tried cocoAspell, but was
    impossible to get it to work with added dictionaries.  A few small
    changes in key-bindings, mostly to do with LaTeX files.
    flyspell-babel-mode now on by default.

1.6 Added convert-quotes function and added recentering on hiding a
    fold.  Updated to TEI P5 0.2.1.

1.7 Upgraded to AUCTeX 11.81 (leaving preview-latex unloaded by
    default).  Made Info buffer killable.  Added Slime, texinfo
    version of dpans, and key-bindings for Slime.

1.8 A few MS Windows bug-fixes, substituted new css-mode.  Removed
    Slime, texinfo version of dpans, and key-bindings for Slime
    (mission creep -- techies can do this for themselves). Get rid of
    backward compatibility for old Emacs versions -- version 22 is now
    required.  A few key-bindings changed, most notably, F1 is now
    find-file, M-F1 is recent-file and Easymacs help has been
    relegated to M-S-F1.  Added W3 browser, to display TEI docs.
    Updated AucTeX and TEI stuff.

2.0 Oops -- version 1.8 required Emacs 22, but failed to throw an
    error if this was not the case.  Also inadvertently inactivated
    screen-lines.el.  So a quick bug-fix release, with version number
    bumped to 2.0 to help indicate the need to upgrade to Emacs 22.
    Added javascript-mode.el from Xemacs.
