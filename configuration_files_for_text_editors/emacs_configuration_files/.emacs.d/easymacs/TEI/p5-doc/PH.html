transcription of primary sources, in particular manuscripts, and
describes how some elements defined in the Common Core module should
be used for this work.  It is expected that this module will also be
useful in the preparation of critical editions, but the module defined
here is distinct from that defined in chapter <a class="link_ptr" href="TC.html" title="19">16  Critical Apparatus</a>, and
may be used independently of it.
</p><div class="p"><span id="id2517135"/>Scholars may wish to record information concerning individual
readings of letters, words or larger units, both within transcriptions
and within editions.  They may also wish to include other editorial
material within transcriptions, such as comments on the status or
possible origin of particular readings, corrections, or text supplied to
fill lacunae.  Further, it is customary in transcriptions to
register certain features of the source, such as ornamentation,
underlining, deletion, areas of damage and lacunae.  This chapter
indicates means to record such information:
<ul><li>first, the problem of recording editorial or other alterations to
the text, such as expansion of abbreviations, corrections, conjectures,
etc. (section <a class="link_ptr" href="PH.html#PHCH" title="Altered, Corrected, and Erroneous Texts">15.1  Altered, Corrected, and Erroneous Texts</a>)</li><li>then, methods of describing important extra-linguistic phenomena
in the source: unusual spaces, lines, page and line breaks, change of
manuscript hand, etc. (section <a class="link_ptr" href="PH.html#PHPH" title="Non-Linguistic Phenomena in the Source">15.2  Non-Linguistic Phenomena in the Source</a>)</li><li>finally, a method of recording material such as running heads,
catch-words, and the like (section <a class="link_ptr" href="PH.html#PHSK" title="Headers, Footers, and Similar Matter">15.3  Headers, Footers, and Similar Matter</a>)</li></ul></div><p><span id="id2517181"/>These recommendations are not intended to meet every
transcriptional circumstance likely to be faced by any scholar.
Rather, they should be regarded as a base which can be elaborated if
necessary by different scholars in different disciplines, with
distinct scholarly domains eventually developing their own document
types.  In time, the feature structure notation developed in chapter
<a class="link_ptr" href="FS.html" title="16">13  Feature Structures</a>, may also permit scholars to tailor the encoding
of complex transcriptional information in ways not here anticipated.
</p><p><span id="id2517197"/>It should be noted that this chapter focuses primarily upon
problems associated with the transcription of manuscript materials,
and that consequently problems of codicology other matters peculiar to
early printed materials are not specifically addressed
here. Nevertheless, many of the recommendations presented may —
mutatis mutandis — also be applied in the encoding of printed
matter. We are conscious that a great deal of work remains to done in
these areas, and that the encoder will need to take even more
individual responsibility than usual in applying the recommendations
of this chapter in such contexts, but believe that these
recommendations form a good basis for such future work.</p><p><span id="id2517233"/>Many of the descriptions below use terms like
‘scribe’, ‘author’,
‘editor’,
‘annotator’,
‘corrector’,
‘transcriber’,
and ‘encoder’, to make
clear how they apply in cases where these roles are distinct.  To the
extent that these roles are not distinct (for example, in authorial
manuscripts where the author and the scribe are the same person) the
interpretation of the markup should be adjusted appropriately.
Many of the elements defined here apply (within limits) also in
cases of printed materials, so ‘compositor’, etc.,
may also be understood as applying where appropriate.</p><p><span id="id2517273"/>As a rule, all elements which may be used in the course of a
transcription of a single witness may also be used in a critical
apparatus, i.e. within the elements proposed in chapter <a class="link_ptr" href="TC.html" title="19">16  Critical Apparatus</a>.
This can generally be achieved by nesting a
particular reading containing tagged elements from a particular witness
within the <code>&lt;rdg&gt;</code> element in an <code>&lt;app&gt;</code> structure.
	</p><p><span id="id2517293"/>Just as a critical apparatus may contain transcriptional elements
within its record of variant readings in various witnesses, one may
record variant readings in an individual witness by use of the apparatus
mechanisms <code>&lt;app&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;rdg&gt;</code>.  This is discussed in
section <a class="link_ptr" href="TC.html#TCTR" title="Using Apparatus Elements in Transcriptions">16.3  Using Apparatus Elements in Transcriptions</a>.
	</p><div class="p"><span id="id2517312"/>This module makes available the following components:

<div><hr/><strong>Module</strong> <em>transcr</em>: Transcription of primary sources<ul><li>Elements defined: <a class="link_odd" href="ref-addSpan.html">addSpan</a> <a class="link_odd" href="ref-delSpan.html">delSpan</a> <a class="link_odd" href="ref-restore.html">restore</a> <a class="link_odd" href="ref-supplied.html">supplied</a> <a class="link_odd" href="ref-hand.html">hand</a> <a class="link_odd" href="ref-handShift.html">handShift</a> <a class="link_odd" href="ref-handList.html">handList</a> <a class="link_odd" href="ref-damage.html">damage</a> <a class="link_odd" href="ref-space.html">space</a> <a class="link_odd" href="ref-fw.html">fw</a> </li></ul><hr/></div>


The selection and combination of modules to form a TEI schema is described in
<a class="link_ptr" href="ST.html#STIN" title="Defining a TEI schema">2.2  Defining a TEI schema</a>.
</div><div class="p"><span id="id2517340"/>The module is organized as follows:
<div><a href="#DTCAD">« <span class="label">include 119: Added and Deleted Spans</span></a> » </div><div><a href="#DPHCD">« <span class="label">include 120: Cancelled Deletions</span></a> » </div><div><a href="#DPHOM">« <span class="label">include 121: Supplied Text</span></a> » </div><div><a href="#DPHHD">« <span class="label">include 122: Hand Shifts</span></a> » </div><div><a href="#DPHDA">« <span class="label">include 123: Damage and Illegiblity</span></a> » </div><div><a href="#DPHSP">« <span class="label">include 124: Spaces in the source</span></a> » </div><div><a href="#DTCHD">« <span class="label">include 125: Headers and footers</span></a> » </div></div><div class="div2" id="PHCH"><h3>15.1  Altered, Corrected, and Erroneous Texts</h3><p><span id="id2517391"/>In the detailed transcription of any source, it may prove necessary
to record various types of actual or potential alteration of the text:
expansion of abbreviations, correction of the text (by the author, by a
scribe, by a later hand, by previous editors or scholars, or by the
current editor or encoder), addition, deletion, or
substitution of material, and the like.  The sections below describe how
such phenomena may be encoded using either elements defined in the core
module (defined in chapter <a class="link_ptr" href="CO.html" title="6">4  Elements Available in All TEI Documents</a>) or specialized elements
available only when the module described in this chapter is
available.</p><div class="div3" id="PHCO"><h4>15.1.1  Use of Core Tags for Transcriptional Work</h4><div class="p"><span id="id2517428"/>In transcribing individual sources 
of any type, encoders may record their corrections, normalizations,
expansions of abbreviations, additions, and omissions
using the elements described in section <a class="link_ptr" href="CO.html#COED" title="Simple Editorial Changes">4.4  Simple Editorial Changes</a>.
Those particularly relevant to this chapter include:
<ul class="specList"><li><b>&lt;<a href="ref-abbr.html">abbr</a>&gt;</b> (abbreviation) contains an abbreviation of any sort.</li><li><b>&lt;<a href="ref-expan.html">expan</a>&gt;</b> (expansion) contains the expansion of an abbreviation.</li><li><b>&lt;<a href="ref-sic.html">sic</a>&gt;</b> contains text reproduced although apparently incorrect or inaccurate.</li><li><b>&lt;<a href="ref-corr.html">corr</a>&gt;</b> (correction) contains the correct form of a passage apparently erroneous in the copy text.</li><li><b>&lt;<a href="ref-add.html">add</a>&gt;</b> (addition) contains letters, words, or phrases inserted in the text by an
author, scribe, annotator, or corrector.</li><li><b>&lt;<a href="ref-del.html">del</a>&gt;</b> (deletion) contains a letter, word or passage deleted, marked as deleted,
or otherwise indicated as superfluous or spurious in the copy text by an
author, scribe, annotator, or corrector.</li><li><b>&lt;<a href="ref-hi.html">hi</a>&gt;</b> (highlighted) marks a word or phrase as graphically distinct from the
surrounding text, for reasons concerning which no claim is
made. </li><li><b>&lt;<a href="ref-gap.html">gap</a>&gt;</b> (omitted material) indicates a point where material has been omitted in a
transcription, whether for editorial reasons described in the TEI
header, as part of sampling practice, or because the material is
illegible or inaudible.</li></ul></div><div class="p"><span id="id2517468"/>When the module for transcription of primary sources is selected,
these elements all gain two specialized attributes for specifying who
is responsible for certain aspects of the interpretation and markup,
and the certainty attributed to the interpretation:
<ul class="specList"><li><b><a href="ref-model.pPart.edit.html">model.pPart.edit</a></b> groups phrase-level elements for simple editorial correction and
transcription. </li></ul>
The specific aspect of the markup described by these attributes differs
on different elements; for further discussion, see the relevant sections
below, especially section <a class="link_ptr" href="PH.html#PHHR" title="Hand, Responsibility, and Certainty Attributes">15.2.2  Hand, Responsibility, and Certainty Attributes</a>.</div><p><span id="id2517488"/>The following sections describe how the core elements just named may
be used in the transcription of primary source materials. Examples of
more complex application in scholarly transcriptions of these core
elements are given, and of their extension by linkage with the
<code>&lt;note&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;respons&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;certainty&gt;</code> elements. Where the
core elements do not satisfy the needs of scholarly transcription,
additional elements are defined.</p></div><div class="div3" id="PHAB"><h4>15.1.2  Abbreviation and Expansion</h4><p><span id="id2517520"/>The writing of manuscripts by hand lends itself to the use of
abbreviation to shorten scribal labour. Commonly occurring letters,
groups of letters, words or even whole phrases, may be represented by
significant marks. This phenomenon of manuscript abbreviation is so
widespread and so various that no taxonomy of it is here attempted.
Instead, methods are shown which allow abbreviations to be encoded using
the core elements mentioned above.</p><div class="p"><span id="id2517531"/>A manuscript abbreviation may be viewed in two ways. One may
transcribe it as a particular sequence of letters or marks upon the
page: thus, a ‘p with a bar through the descender’, a
‘superscript hook’, a ‘macron’. One may also interpret the
abbreviation in terms of the letter or letters it is seen as standing
for: thus, ‘per’, ‘re’, ‘n’. Both of these views are
supported by these Guidelines. The entity reference system allows the
encoder to declare whatever entities are needed, using entity names
like <span class="ident-ge">p-underbar</span>, <span class="ident-ge">sup-hook</span>, or <span class="ident-ge">macron</span>.
Furthermore, each entity reference may be linked to an image of the
abbreviation itself, so that the reader might see a rendering of the
text's appearance. Alternatively, the encoder may transcribe the
letter or letters he or she believes the abbreviation stands for, as
the content of an <code>&lt;expan&gt;</code> element: thus
<div class="pre"> <span class="element">&lt;expan&gt;</span>per<span class="element">&lt;/expan&gt;</span><br/> <span class="element">&lt;expan&gt;</span>re<span class="element">&lt;/expan&gt;</span><br/> <span class="element">&lt;expan&gt;</span>n<span class="element">&lt;/expan&gt;</span></div></div><div class="p"><span id="id2517601"/>These two methods of coding abbreviation may also be combined. An
encoder may record, for any abbreviation, both the sequence of letters
or marks which constitutes it, and its sense, that is, the letter or
letters for which it is believed to stand. For example, the
abbreviations of euery persone in the following
fragment<a class="notelink" href="#Note114"><sup>114</sup></a> may be
expanded in transcription:  
<div class="pre_eg">eu&lt;expan resp="#mp"&gt;er&lt;/expan&gt;y
&lt;expan&gt;per&lt;/expan&gt;sone that
loketh after heuen hath a place in this ladder</div>
Alternatively, the encoding may represent only the fact of abbreviation:
<div class="pre_eg">eu&lt;abbr  resp="#mp"&gt;&amp;er;&lt;/abbr&gt;y
&lt;abbr &gt;&amp;p-underbar;&lt;/abbr&gt;sone that
loketh after heuen hath a place in this ladder</div></div><p><span id="id2517640"/>The choice between the <code>&lt;expan&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code>
elements is left to the encoder. As a rule, the <code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code> element
should be preferred where it is wished to signify that the content of
the element is an abbreviation, without necessarily indicating what the
abbreviation may stand for. The <code>&lt;expan&gt;</code> element should be used
where it is wished to signify that the content of the element is an
expanded text, without necessarily indicating the abbreviation used in
the original. The decision as to which (<code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code> or
<code>&lt;expan&gt;</code>) to use may vary from abbreviation to abbreviation; there
is no requirement that the one system be used throughout a
transcription. However, processing may be simplified if one only of
these is used throughout a transcription. The choice is likely to be a
matter of editorial policy, which might be applied consistently
throughout. If the highest priority is to transcribe the text
literatim, while indicating the presence of abbreviations, the choice
will be to use <code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code> throughout. If the highest priority is to
present a reading transcription, while indicating that some letters or
words are expansions of abbreviations, the choice will be to use
<code>&lt;expan&gt;</code> throughout.</p><div class="p"><span id="id2517694"/>Further information may be attached to instances of these elements by
the <code>&lt;note&gt;</code> element, on which see section <a class="link_ptr" href="CO.html#CONO" title="Notes, Annotation, and Indexing">4.8  Notes, Annotation, and Indexing</a>, and
by use of the <span class="att">resp</span> and <span class="att">cert</span> attributes. In this
instance from the English <i>Brut</i>,<a class="notelink" href="#Note115"><sup>115</sup></a>
a note is attached to an editorial expansion of the tail on the final d
of good to goode:
<div class="pre">For alle the while that I had
good <span class="element">&lt;expan <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="exp01"&gt;</span>e<span class="element">&lt;/expan&gt;</span><br/>I was welbeloued</div>
Then the note:
<div class="pre"> <span class="element">&lt;note <span class="attribute">target</span>="#exp01"&gt;</span>The stroke added to 
the final d could signify the plural ending (-es, -is, -ys&gt;)
but the singular <span class="element">&lt;hi <span class="attribute">rend</span>="it"&gt;</span>good<span class="element">&lt;/hi&gt;</span> was used with the meaning<br/> <span class="element">&lt;q&gt;</span>property<span class="element">&lt;/q&gt;</span>, <span class="element">&lt;q&gt;</span>wealth<span class="element">&lt;/q&gt;</span>, at this time (v. examples<br/> quoted in OED, sb. Good, C. 7, b, c, d and 8 spec.)<span class="element">&lt;/note&gt;</span></div>
The editor might declare a degree of certainty for this expansion, based
on the OED examples, and state the responsibility for the expansion:
<div class="pre">For alle the while that I had
good <span class="element">&lt;expan <span class="attribute">resp</span>="#mp" <span class="attribute">cert</span>="90"&gt;</span>e<span class="element">&lt;/expan&gt;</span><br/>I was welbeloued</div>
Observe that the <span class="att">cert</span> and <span class="att">resp</span> attributes may be
used with the <code>&lt;expan&gt;</code> element only to indicate respectively
confidence in the content of the element (i.e. the expansion), and
confidence in the
responsibility for suggesting this expansion. </div><div class="p"><span id="id2517805"/>The <code>&lt;choice&gt;</code> element may be used to indicate that the
proposed expansion is one way of encoding what might equally well be
represented as an abbreviation, represented by the hooked D, as follows:
<div class="pre">For alle the while that I had
good <span class="element">&lt;choice&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;abbr&gt;</span>ɽ<span class="element">&lt;/abbr&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;expan <span class="attribute">resp</span>="#mp" <span class="attribute">cert</span>="90"&gt;</span>e<span class="element">&lt;/expan&gt;</span><br/> <span class="element">&lt;/choice&gt;</span><br/>I was welbeloued</div>
If it is desired to express aspects of certainty and responsibility for
some other aspect of the use of these elements, then the mechanisms
discussed in chapter <a class="link_ptr" href="CE.html" title="17">14  Certainty and Responsibility</a> should be used. See also <a class="link_ptr" href="PH.html#PHHR" title="Hand, Responsibility, and Certainty Attributes">15.2.2  Hand, Responsibility, and Certainty Attributes</a> for discussion of the issues of certainty and
responsibility in the context of transcription.</div><p><span id="id2517845"/>If more than one expansion for the same abbreviation is to be
recorded, multiple notes may be supplied. It may also be appropriate
to use the markup for critical apparatus; an example is given in
section <a class="link_ptr" href="TC.html#TCTR" title="Using Apparatus Elements in Transcriptions">16.3  Using Apparatus Elements in Transcriptions</a>.</p></div><div class="div3" id="PHCC"><h4>15.1.3  Correction and Conjecture</h4><div class="p"><span id="id2517868"/>The <code>&lt;sic&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;corr&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;choice&gt;</code> elements, defined in the Common Core module
may be used to register authorial or scribal corrections within a
witness. For example, in the manuscript of William James's <i>A
Pluralistic Universe</i>, edited by Fredson Bowers (Cambridge:
Harvard University Press, 1977) a sentence first written
<blockquote class="display"><p>One must have lived longer with this system,
to appreciate its advantages.</p></blockquote>
has been modified by James to begin ‘But one must ...’, without the
inital capital O having been reduced to lowercase. This non-standard
orthography could be recorded thus:
<div class="pre">But  <span class="element">&lt;sic&gt;</span>One<span class="element">&lt;/sic&gt;</span> must have lived ...</div>
or corrected:
<div class="pre">But  <span class="element">&lt;corr&gt;</span>one<span class="element">&lt;/corr&gt;</span> must have lived ...</div>
or the two possibilities might be represented as a choice:
<div class="pre">But  <span class="element">&lt;choice&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;sic&gt;</span>One<span class="element">&lt;/sic&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;corr&gt;</span>one<span class="element">&lt;/corr&gt;</span><br/> <span class="element">&lt;/choice&gt;</span> must have lived ...</div></div><div class="p"><span id="id2517932"/>In this example from Albertus Magnus,<a class="notelink" href="#Note116"><sup>116</sup></a>
both a manuscript error angues and its correction
augens are registered within a  <code>&lt;choice&gt;</code> element:
<div class="pre">Nos autem iam ostendimus quod nutrimentum
et  <span class="element">&lt;choice&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;sic&gt;</span>angues<span class="element">&lt;/sic&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;corr&gt;</span>augens<span class="element">&lt;/corr&gt;</span><br/> <span class="element">&lt;/choice&gt;</span>.</div></div><p><span id="id2517980"/>As with <code>&lt;expan&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code>, the
choice as to whether to record simply that there is an apparent error,
or simply that a correction has been applied, or to record both
possible readings within a  <code>&lt;choice&gt;</code> element is
left to the encoder. The choice is likely to be a matter of editorial policy,
which might be applied consistently throughout or decided case by case.
If the highest priority is to present an uncorrected transcription while
noting perceived errors in the original, the choice will typically
be to use only <code>&lt;sic&gt;</code> throughout. If the highest priority is to
present a reading transcription, while indicating that perceived errors
in the original have been corrected, the choice will be to use
only <code>&lt;corr&gt;</code> throughout.</p><div class="p"><span id="id2518028"/>Further information may be attached to instances of these elements by
the <code>&lt;note&gt;</code> element and <span class="att">resp</span> and <span class="att">cert</span>
attributes. Here, two separate corrections in Dudo of S. Quentin<a class="notelink" href="#Note117"><sup>117</sup></a>
are assigned the same note. First the correction is represented within
a <code>&lt;choice&gt;</code> element:
<div class="pre">quamuis  <span class="element">&lt;choice <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="sic01"&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;sic&gt;</span>mens<span class="element">&lt;/sic&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;corr&gt;</span>iners<span class="element">&lt;/corr&gt;</span><br/> <span class="element">&lt;/choice&gt;</span> que nutu dei<br/>gesta sunt ... unde esset uiriliter<br/><br/> <span class="element">&lt;choice <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="sic02"&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;corr&gt;</span>uegetata<span class="element">&lt;/corr&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;sic&gt;</span>negata<span class="element">&lt;/sic&gt;</span><br/> <span class="element">&lt;/choice&gt;</span></div>
then the note, linked to the <span class="att">xml:id</span> of the two <code>&lt;choice&gt;</code> elements
<div class="pre"> <span class="element">&lt;note <span class="attribute">target</span>="#sic01 #sic02"&gt;</span>Substitution of a more

element to signify the conjectural status of a particular editorial
reading, with the <span class="att">resp</span> attribute used to identify the scholar
responsible for the conjecture. In this example, editorial confidence
in E. Talbot Donaldson's emendation of the Hengwrt manuscript reading
wight to wright in line 117 of Chaucer's
<i>The Wife of Bath's Prologue</i> may be marked as follows:
<div class="pre">Telle me also, to what conclusioun

The editor might also conveniently add a note referring to Donaldson's
discussion of this passage:
<div class="pre"> <span class="element">&lt;note <span class="attribute">target</span>="#corr117"&gt;</span>This emendation of the Hengwrt copy text,
based on a Latin source and on the reading of three late

may be held within an <code>&lt;app&gt;</code> structure, in the same way that
alternative expansions are so grouped in the example given in section
<a class="link_ptr" href="TC.html#TCTR" title="Using Apparatus Elements in Transcriptions">16.3  Using Apparatus Elements in Transcriptions</a>. Here, Donaldson's conjectured emendation of the
Hengwrt manuscript may be recorded not only alongside the editorial
transcription but also alongside another conjecture:

transcription:  by default, responsibility is assigned to the scholar(s)
responsible for the transcription, as identified in the TEI header.  The
conjectures are held within <code>&lt;corr&gt;</code> elements, contained within the
<code>&lt;rdg&gt;</code> elements. The <span class="att">resp</span> attribute identifying
responsibility for each correction is attached to the outer
<code>&lt;rdg&gt;</code>, and inherited by the inner <code>&lt;corr&gt;</code> element. Note
too that the support for these conjectures in other manuscripts can be
noted in the <span class="att">wit</span> attribute in the <code>&lt;rdg&gt;</code> element.</p><p><span id="id2518263"/>The <span class="att">cert</span> and <span class="att">resp</span> attributes may be used with
the <code>&lt;corr&gt;</code> element only to indicate respectively confidence in
the content of the element (i.e. the correction), and confidence in the
responsibility for suggesting this correction or conjecture.  
If it is desired to express aspects of certainty and responsibility for
some other aspect of the use of these elements, then the mechanisms
discussed in chapter <a class="link_ptr" href="CE.html" title="17">14  Certainty and Responsibility</a> should be used. See also <a class="link_ptr" href="PH.html#PHHR" title="Hand, Responsibility, and Certainty Attributes">15.2.2  Hand, Responsibility, and Certainty Attributes</a> for discussion of the issues of certainty and
responsibility in the context of transcription.</p></div><div class="div3" id="PHAD"><h4>15.1.4  Additions and Deletions</h4><div class="p"><span id="id2518316"/>Additions and deletions to a text may be described using the
following elements:
<ul class="specList"><li><b>&lt;<a href="ref-add.html">add</a>&gt;</b> (addition) contains letters, words, or phrases inserted in the text by an
author, scribe, annotator, or corrector.</li><li><b>&lt;<a href="ref-addSpan.html">addSpan</a>&gt;</b> (added span of text) marks the beginning of a longer sequence of text added by an
  author, scribe, annotator or corrector (see also add).</li><li><b>&lt;<a href="ref-del.html">del</a>&gt;</b> (deletion) contains a letter, word or passage deleted, marked as deleted,
or otherwise indicated as superfluous or spurious in the copy text by an
author, scribe, annotator, or corrector.</li><li><b>&lt;<a href="ref-delSpan.html">delSpan</a>&gt;</b> (deleted span of text) marks the beginning of a longer sequence of text deleted,
marked as deleted, or otherwise signaled as superfluous or spurious by an
author, scribe, annotator, or corrector.</li></ul>
Of these, <code>&lt;add&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> are included in the core tag
set, while <code>&lt;addSpan&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;delSpan&gt;</code> are available only when
using the module defined in this chapter.</div><div class="p"><span id="id2518356"/>As described in section <a class="link_ptr" href="CO.html#COED" title="Simple Editorial Changes">4.4  Simple Editorial Changes</a>, the <code>&lt;add&gt;</code> element
indicating material added may be used to signify manuscript additions or
insertions, be they authorial or scribal. In the autograph manuscript
of Max Beerbohm's <i>The Golden Drugget</i>,<a class="notelink" href="#Note118"><sup>118</sup></a>
the author's addition of "do ever" may be recorded as follows, with the
<span class="att">hand</span> attribute indicating that the addition was Beerbohm's
by referencing a <code>&lt;hand&gt;</code> element defined elsewhere in the document:
<div class="pre">Some things are best at first sight. Others — and
here is one of them —  <span class="element">&lt;add <span class="attribute">hand</span>="#mb"&gt;</span>do ever<span class="element">&lt;/add&gt;</span><br/>improve by recognition ....<br/><br/> <span class="element">&lt;hand <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="mb" <span class="attribute">scribe</span>="Max Beerbohm holograph"/&gt;</span></div>
Similarly, the <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> element indicating material deleted may be
used to signify manuscript deletions. In the autograph manuscript of D.
H. Lawrence's <i>Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani</i><a class="notelink" href="#Note119"><sup>119</sup></a>, the author's deletion of
my may be recorded as follows. As well as the
<span class="att">hand</span> attribute indicating that the deletion was Lawrence's,
the <span class="att">rend</span> attribute indicates that the deletion was by
strike-through:
<div class="pre">For I hate this  <span class="element">&lt;del <span class="attribute">rend</span>="strikethrough" <span class="attribute">hand</span>="#dhl"&gt;</span>my<span class="element">&lt;/del&gt;</span> body,<br/>which is so dear to me<br/>...<br/><br/> <span class="element">&lt;hand <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="dhl" <span class="attribute">scribe</span>="holograph"/&gt;</span></div>
If deletions are classified systematically, the <span class="att">type</span>
attribute should normally
be used to indicate the classification; when they
are classified by the manner in which they were effected, or by their
appearance, however,
this will lead to a certain arbitrariness in deciding
whether to use the <span class="att">type</span> or the <span class="att">rend</span> attribute
to hold the information. In general, it is recommended that the
<span class="att">rend</span> attribute be used for description of the appearance
or method of deletion, and that the <span class="att">type</span> attribute be
reserved for higher level or more abstract classifications.</div><p><span id="id2518490"/>Further characteristics of the addition and deletion, e.g. the date,
or ink, may be needed for detailed transcription of manuscripts. Such
characteristics may conveniently be recorded as attributes of the
<code>&lt;add&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> element. The specific attributes required
may be added to the formal declaration of these elements by using the
techniques described in chapter <a class="link_ptr" href="USE.html#MD" title="29">24.2  Modifying and Customizing the TEI DTD</a>.</p><div class="p"><span id="id2518510"/>The <code>&lt;add&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> elements defined in the core tag
set available in all TEI documents will suffice for describing typically
brief additions and deletions in the text being transcribed. On
occasion, it will be necessary to record an addition or deletion which
crosses a structural boundary in the text being encoded, for example the
addition or deletion from a manuscript of a section containing several
distinct structural subdivisions, such as poems or prose items. These
are most conveniently encoded using the <code>&lt;addSpan&gt;</code> and
<code>&lt;delSpan&gt;</code> elements, available in the module defined
in this chapter. In this example of the use of <code>&lt;addSpan&gt;</code>, the
insertion of a gathering containing four neo-Eddic poems into
<i>Landsbókasafn</i><a class="notelink" href="#Note120"><sup>120</sup></a> by Helgi
Ólafsson is recorded as follows.  

A <code>&lt;hand&gt;</code> element is
first declared, within the header of the document, to associate
the identifier <strong>heol</strong> with Helgi. In the body of the
text, an <code>&lt;addSpan&gt;</code> element
is placed to mark the beginning of the span of added text.  The
<span class="att">hand</span> attribute ascribes the responsibility for the addition
to the manuscript to Helgi, and the <span class="att">to</span> attribute declares the
identifier for the anchor which marks the end of the added text:
<div class="pre"> <span class="element">&lt;hand <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="heol" <span class="attribute">n</span>="Helgi Ólafsson"/&gt;</span><br/> <span class="element">&lt;addSpan <span class="attribute">n</span>="added gathering" <span class="attribute">hand</span>="#heol" <span class="attribute">spanTo</span>="#p025"/&gt;</span><br/> <span class="element">&lt;anchor <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="p025"/&gt;</span></div></div><div class="p"><span id="id2518606"/>In this example of the use of the <code>&lt;delSpan&gt;</code> element, a full
two lines of Thomas Moore's autograph of the second version of
<i>Lalla Rookh</i><a class="notelink" href="#Note121"><sup>121</sup></a> are marked for omission by vertical
strike-through. The two lines cross the structural line division marked
<span class="tag">&lt;l n='2'&gt;</span>, so it would not be possible to use a single
<code>&lt;del&gt;</code> element, since it would have to span the <code>&lt;l&gt;</code> marker.
The lines also themselves include a further deletion and addition.  The
<code>&lt;delSpan&gt;</code> element indicates the begining of the span marked for
deletion, with the <span class="att">to</span> attribute giving the identifier
<span class="val">#delend01</span> for an <code>&lt;anchor&gt;</code> element which marks the end of the span of text so
marked:
<div class="pre"> <span class="element">&lt;l <span class="attribute">n</span>="1"&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;delSpan <span class="attribute">rend</span>="vertical strike" <span class="attribute">spanTo</span>="#delend01"/&gt;</span><br/>    Tis moonlight <span class="element">&lt;del&gt;</span>upon<span class="element">&lt;/del&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;add&gt;</span>over<span class="element">&lt;/add&gt;</span> Oman's sky<span class="element">&lt;/l&gt;</span><br/> <span class="element">&lt;l <span class="attribute">n</span>="2"&gt;</span>Her isles of pearl look lovelily<span class="element">&lt;anchor <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="delend01"/&gt;</span><br/> <span class="element">&lt;/l&gt;</span></div></div><p><span id="id2518686"/>The text deleted must be at least partially legible, in order for the
encoder to be able to transcribe it.  If it is not legible at all, the
<code>&lt;gap&gt;</code> element should be used to signal that the text was not transcribed,
because it could not be; the <span class="att">reason</span> attribute
can give the cause of the omission from the transcription as
‘deletion, illegible’.  The <code>&lt;gap&gt;</code> element may optionally be
enclosed by a <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> element, if it is thought useful to record
the deletion explicitly using this element.  If the deleted text is
partially legible, the <code>&lt;unclear&gt;</code> element described in section <a class="link_ptr" href="PH.html#PHDA" title="Damage, Illegibility, and Supplied Text">15.2.3  Damage, Illegibility, and Supplied Text</a>
 should be used to signal the areas of text which
cannot be read with confidence; it too may be enclosed within a
<code>&lt;del&gt;</code> element.  See further section <a class="link_ptr" href="PH.html#PHOM" title="Text Omitted from or Supplied in the Transcription">15.1.7  Text Omitted from or Supplied in the Transcription</a> and

in the Common Core module and are available in all TEI documents.  The
elements <code>&lt;addSpan&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;delSpan&gt;</code> have the following formal
declarations:

perhaps the most common of all phenomena requiring special treatment
in transcription of primary textual sources.
It may be simply one word overwriting another, or
deletion of one word and its replacement by another written above it by
the same hand at the one time; the deletion and replacement may be done
by different hands at different times; there may be a long chain of
substitutions on the one stretch of text, with uncertainty as to the
order of substitution and as to the final reading.</p><div class="p"><span id="id2519175"/>Three different methods may be used to express substitution of one
stretch of text by another:
<ul><li>the <code>&lt;sic&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;corr&gt;</code> elements, either individually
to encode a single substitution or nested to encode a sequence of
substitutions;</li><li>the <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;add&gt;</code> elements, used in sequence to
show that text was first deleted then other text inserted;</li><li>the <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;add&gt;</code> elements, used within an
<code>&lt;app&gt;</code> structure (as defined in chapter <a class="link_ptr" href="TC.html" title="19">16  Critical Apparatus</a>) to
indicate that the deleted and added text within the individual reading
elements making up the <code>&lt;app&gt;</code> structure are variants of one
another.</li></ul>
The use of all three of these is illustrated in the following encodings
of the second line of <i>Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani</i> from
the Lawrence manuscript mentioned above.  Lawrence first wrote ‘How it
galls me, what a galling shadow’.  Subsequently, he deleted
galls and wrote dogs above the deletion.</div><div class="p"><span id="id2519252"/>This substitution could be registered using the first method outlined
above, as a correction using the <code>&lt;sic&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;corr&gt;</code>
elements within a <code>&lt;choice&gt;</code> element.
Note the use of the <span class="att">resp</span> attribute on the <code>&lt;corr&gt;</code>
element to assign the correction to Lawrence.  (For further information
on the <span class="att">hand</span> and <span class="att">resp</span> attributes, see section
<a class="link_ptr" href="PH.html#PHHR" title="Hand, Responsibility, and Certainty Attributes">15.2.2  Hand, Responsibility, and Certainty Attributes</a>.) 
<div class="pre">How it  <span class="element">&lt;choice&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;sic&gt;</span>galls<span class="element">&lt;/sic&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;corr <span class="attribute">resp</span>="#DHL"&gt;</span>dogs<span class="element">&lt;/corr&gt;</span><br/> <span class="element">&lt;/choice&gt;</span><br/>me, what a galling shadow</div>
This substitution could be registered using the second method outlined
above, using the <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;add&gt;</code> elements in sequence to
reflect the fact that text was first deleted then other text inserted:
<div class="pre">How it  <span class="element">&lt;del <span class="attribute">type</span>="overstrike" <span class="attribute">hand</span>="#dhl"&gt;</span>galls<span class="element">&lt;/del&gt;</span><br/> <span class="element">&lt;add <span class="attribute">place</span>="supralinear" <span class="attribute">hand</span>="#dhl"&gt;</span>dogs<span class="element">&lt;/add&gt;</span><br/>me, what a galling shadow</div>
This substitution could be registered using the third method outlined
above, using the <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;add&gt;</code> elements within an
<code>&lt;app&gt;</code> structure to indicate that the deleted and added texts are
variants of one another.  Note that within the <code>&lt;app&gt;</code> structure
the <span class="att">hand</span> attribute is moved from the inner <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> and
<code>&lt;add&gt;</code> elements to the outer <code>&lt;rdg&gt;</code> element:
<div class="pre">How it
   <span class="element">&lt;app&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;rdg <span class="attribute">hand</span>="#dhl"&gt;</span><br/>   <span class="element">&lt;del <span class="attribute">type</span>="overstrike"&gt;</span> galls<span class="element">&lt;/del&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;/rdg&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;rdg <span class="attribute">hand</span>="#dhl"&gt;</span><br/>   <span class="element">&lt;add <span class="attribute">place</span>="supralinear"&gt;</span> dogs<span class="element">&lt;/add&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;/rdg&gt;</span><br/> <span class="element">&lt;/app&gt;</span><br/>me, what a galling shadow</div>
Each of these three methods has its particular advantages and
disadvantages.  The first method (use of <code>&lt;sic&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;corr&gt;</code>)
is compact and indicates clearly that one text is a substitute for
another.  However, it provides no clear means of stating how the
substitution is effected:  whether by deletion through strike-through, or
underdotting, or erasure, followed by interlinear insertion, or marginal
insertion.  (The global <span class="att">rend</span> attribute might conceivably be
used, but this may not be thought an obvious place to put such
information.)  In a transcription where this information is not felt to
be important, however, this method will suffice to indicate simple cases
of direct substitution of one text for another.</div><p><span id="id2519421"/>The second method (use of a <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;add&gt;</code> sequence)
is also compact and provides means for exact declaration of how the
deletion and insertion are effected.  However, it does not indicate
explicitly that one text is a substitute for another.  It is left for
the reader or the application to infer from the <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> and
<code>&lt;add&gt;</code> sequence that the insertion is to be taken as a
substitution for the deletion.  In many transcriptions, the inference
may be safely drawn for simple cases of direct substitution of one text
for another.  In other transcriptions, for example of complex authorial
manuscripts, this inference may prove fragile; those who desire
to express clearly that an adjacent addition and deletion are not
independent but constitute a single act of substitution will therefore
wish to avoid this method.  Others, of course, may prefer it for
precisely the same reason, namely that it avoids prejudging the issue of
whether adjacent deletions and additions are independent or joined.</p><div class="p"><span id="id2519454"/>The third method (use of the <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;add&gt;</code> elements
within an <code>&lt;app&gt;</code> structure) provides means both for exact
declaration of how the deletion and insertion are effected and for
explicit indication that one text is a substitute for another.  Further,
the exact sequence of readings may also be declared by use of the
<span class="att">varSeq</span> attribute on the <code>&lt;rdg&gt;</code> element, as follows:
<div class="pre">How it
   <span class="element">&lt;app&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;rdg <span class="attribute">varSeq</span>="1" <span class="attribute">hand</span>="#dhl"&gt;</span><br/>   <span class="element">&lt;del&gt;</span>galls<span class="element">&lt;/del&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;/rdg&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;rdg <span class="attribute">varSeq</span>="2" <span class="attribute">hand</span>="#dhl"&gt;</span><br/>   <span class="element">&lt;add&gt;</span>dogs<span class="element">&lt;/add&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;/rdg&gt;</span><br/> <span class="element">&lt;/app&gt;</span><br/>me, what a galling shadow</div>
Here, the combination of the <span class="att">hand</span> and <span class="att">varSeq</span>
attributes suffices to inform the reader of the authorial substitution
of dogs for galls.</div><p><span id="id2519527"/>Similarly, the <span class="att">varSeq</span> attribute might be used in a
transcription of the manuscripts of James Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i>
to indicate the sequence of Joyce's corrections which is implicit in
Hans Walther Gabler's reconstruction of the ‘overlay’ levels of
Joyce's transcriptions.  This third method is the most powerful and
unambiguous of the three methods and enables the widest range of
processing possibilities, at the expense of introducing a heavier
burden of markup into the text. Production of such documents should
therefore not be undertaken without markup-aware editors.  
Applications of some
sophistication may be needed to make full use of all the information
that may be held within an <code>&lt;app&gt;</code> structure.  In the absence of
such applications, scholars may feel that the present cost of the more
informative coding using <code>&lt;app&gt;</code> structures outweighs the future
benefits.  In making such decisions, it should however be kept in mind
that the capabilities of software at the time a project begins will often
be wholly irrelevant when the project is completed some years later.</p><div class="p"><span id="id2519566"/>The Lawrence example above shows the three methods used for encoding
a single substitution of one reading for another.  
In the example from William James, first written out by James as ‘One
must have lived longer with this system, to appreciate its
advantages’ the word this is first replaced by
such a and this is then replaced by a.
<a class="notelink" href="#Note122"><sup>122</sup></a>
It may be encoded using the second method, with the two changes being
treated as a sequence of additions and deletions:
<div class="pre">One must have lived longer with
 <span class="element">&lt;del&gt;</span>this<span class="element">&lt;/del&gt;</span><br/> <span class="element">&lt;del&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;add&gt;</span>such a<span class="element">&lt;/add&gt;</span><br/> <span class="element">&lt;/del&gt;</span><br/> <span class="element">&lt;add&gt;</span>a<span class="element">&lt;/add&gt;</span> system, to appreciate its advantages.</div>
Note the nesting of an <code>&lt;add&gt;</code> element within a <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> to
record text first added, then deleted in the source.</div><div class="p"><span id="id2519634"/>It may be encoded using the third method, with each reading in the
series contained in a <code>&lt;rdg&gt;</code> element within an <code>&lt;app&gt;</code>

The three encodings of this slightly more complex example illustrate the
general truth that the more information involving substitutions there is
to be encoded, the clearer become the advantages of the use of the
<code>&lt;app&gt;</code> method over the other two methods.  As a rule, it is
recommended that the <code>&lt;app&gt;</code> method be used for encoding
substitutions of any complexity.  It is also desirable that the one
method be used throughout any one transcription.  Accordingly, the
<code>&lt;app&gt;</code> method is recommended for text critical transcription of
primary textual materials requiring encoding of instances of other than
straightforward substitution.</div></div><div class="div3" id="PHCD"><h4>15.1.6  Cancellation of Deletions and Other Markings</h4><div class="p"><span id="id2519707"/>An author or scribe may mark a word or phrase in some way, and then

non-linguistic characteristics of the source text which are often of
particular interest in the transcription of primary sources:  points at
which one scribe takes over from another, or at which ink, pen, or other
characteristics of the writing change; points at which the source is
damaged or imperfectly legible; and unusual spaces or lines in the
source.  A discussion of the usage of the <span class="att">hand</span>,
<span class="att">resp</span>, and <span class="att">cert</span> attributes is also included.
Methods for recording page breaks, column breaks, and line breaks in the
source are described in section <a class="link_ptr" href="CO.html#COXR" title="Simple Links and Cross References">4.6  Simple Links and Cross References</a>.</p><div class="div3" id="PHDH"><h4>15.2.1  Document Hands</h4><p><span id="id2520586"/>For many text-critical purposes it is important to signal the person
responsible (the <em>hand</em>) for the writing of a whole document, a
stretch of text within a document, or a particular feature within the
document.  The hand may be of a known and named scribe or author, as
DHL, or may be described by an anonymous formula, as hand
one.  Where the hand is associated with a particular feature tagged
within a document, this may be indicated by the value of the
<span class="att">hand</span> attribute on that feature.  The examples given above of
the use of the <span class="att">hand</span> attribute with coding of additions and
deletions illustrate this. </p><div class="p"><span id="id2520617"/>In other cases, it may be necessary to identify a document hand
without there being any association of that hand with any specific
tagged document feature.  The <code>&lt;handList&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;hand&gt;</code>
elements are used in the TEI header (in the <code>&lt;profileDesc&gt;</code>
element) to define each unique hand or scribe distinguished by the
encoder in the document.  One such element must appear within the header
for each hand distinguished in the text, and each such element should
bear a distinct identifier as the value of its global
<span class="att">xml:id</span> attribute.
Each location where a change
of hands occurs may then be marked in the text by the empty
<code>&lt;handShift&gt;</code> element, which specifies the hand concerned by
giving the same identifier.
<ul class="specList"><li><b>&lt;<a href="ref-hand.html">hand</a>&gt;</b> used in the header to define each distinct scribe or
handwriting style.</li><li><b>&lt;<a href="ref-handList.html">handList</a>&gt;</b> contains a series of hand elements listing the
different hands of the source.</li><li><b>&lt;<a href="ref-handShift.html">handShift</a>&gt;</b> marks the beginning of a sequence of text written in a new
hand, or of a change in the scribe, writing style, ink or character
of the document hand.</li></ul></div><p><span id="id2520671"/>The attributes <span class="att">old</span> and <span class="att">new</span> on the
<code>&lt;handShift&gt;</code> element refer to the order of the text in the
transcription:  ‘old’ is the material before the
<code>&lt;handShift&gt;</code>, ‘new’ the material following.  This will
ordinarily, but not necessarily, be the order in which the material was
originally written.  Neither attribute is required but both are
recommended where there is a new hand, as opposed to a new writing style
in the one hand.  The <span class="att">writing</span> attribute will be most often
used to encode descriptive shifts which the transcriber perceives within
a manuscript and which may or may not be associated with or denote
changes in scribe or content.  The particular values encoded will depend
upon the needs of the transcriber. Where many values are to be encoded,
feature structures provide an alternative means of encoding these. </p><p><span id="id2520715"/>A single hand may employ different writing styles and inks within a
document, or may change character.  For example, the writing style might
shift from ‘anglicana’ to ‘secretary’, or the ink from blue to
brown, or the character of the hand may change.  Any such changes should
be indicated by assigning a new value to the appropriate attribute
within the <code>&lt;handShift&gt;</code> element.  The one hand may employ
different renditions within the one writing style, for example medieval
scribes indicating a structural division by emboldening all the words
within a line.  These should be indicated by use of the <span class="att">rend</span>
attribute on an element, in the same manner as underlining, emboldening,
font shifts, etc., in transcription of a printed text, rather than by
introducing a new <code>&lt;handShift&gt;</code> element.</p><div class="p"><span id="id2520749"/>In this example<a class="notelink" href="#Note124"><sup>124</sup></a> first the

following encoding of the William James passage mentioned above in
section <a class="link_ptr" href="PH.html#PHCC" title="Correction and Conjecture">15.1.3  Correction and Conjecture</a>.  In this example, the But
inserted by James is tagged as an <code>&lt;add&gt;</code>, and the consequent
editorial correction of One to one treated
separately:
<div class="pre"> <span class="element">&lt;add <span class="attribute">place</span>="supralinear" <span class="attribute">resp</span>="#FB" <span class="attribute">hand</span>="#WJ"&gt;</span>But<span class="element">&lt;/add&gt;</span><br/> <span class="element">&lt;choice&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;sic&gt;</span>One<span class="element">&lt;/sic&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;corr <span class="attribute">resp</span>="#FB"&gt;</span>one<span class="element">&lt;/corr&gt;</span><br/> <span class="element">&lt;/choice&gt;</span> must have lived ...</div>
As in this example, <span class="att">hand</span> should be reserved for indicating
the hand of any form of marking—here, addition but also deletion,
correction, annotation, underlining, etc.—within the primary text
being transcribed.  The scribal or authorial responsibility for this
marking may be inferred from the value of the <span class="att">hand</span> attribute.
The value of the <span class="att">hand</span> attribute should be one of the hand
identifiers declared in the document header (see section <a class="link_ptr" href="PH.html#PHDH" title="Document Hands">15.2.1  Document Hands</a>).</div><p><span id="id2521923"/>As in this example, the <span class="att">resp</span> on a particular element
should be used only to indicate the particular aspect of responsibility
defined in these <i>Guidelines</i> as appropriate to the
<span class="att">resp</span> attribute for that element.  In the case of the
<code>&lt;add&gt;</code> element, the <span class="att">resp</span> attribute is defined as
signifying the responsibility for identifying the hand of the
addition:  here, Bowers' identification of the hand as that of William
James.  In the case of the <code>&lt;corr&gt;</code> element, the <span class="att">resp</span>
attribute is defined as signifying the responsibility for supplying the
intellectual content of the correction reported in the transcription:
here, Bowers' correction of ‘One’ to ‘one’.</p><p><span id="id2521967"/>As these examples show, the field of application of the
<span class="att">resp</span> attributes varies from element to element.  In some
cases, it applies to the content of the element (<code>&lt;corr&gt;</code> and
<code>&lt;expan&gt;</code>); in others it applies to the value of a particular
attribute (<code>&lt;sic&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;del&gt;</code>, etc.).  In all
cases where both the <span class="att">cert</span> and <span class="att">resp</span> attributes are
defined for a particular element, the two attributes refer to the same
aspect of the markup.  The one indicates who is intellectually
responsible for some item of information, the other indicates the degree
of confidence in the information.  Thus, for a
correction, the <span class="att">resp</span> attribute signifies the person
responsible for supplying the correction, while the <span class="att">cert</span>
attribute signifies the degree of editorial confidence felt in that
correction.  For the expansion of an abbreviation, the
<span class="att">resp</span> attribute signifies the person responsible for supplying
the expansion and the <span class="att">cert</span> attribute signifies the degree of
editorial confidence felt in the expansion.</p><p><span id="id2522028"/>This close definition of the use of the <span class="att">resp</span> and
<span class="att">cert</span> attributes with each element is intended to provide for
the most frequent circumstances in which encoders might wish to make
unambiguous statements regarding the responsibility for and certainty of
aspects of their encoding.  The <span class="att">resp</span> and <span class="att">cert</span>
attributes, as so defined, give a convenient mechanism for this.
However, there will be cases where it is desired to state responsibility
for and certainty concerning other aspects of the encoding.  For
example, one may wish in the case of an apparent addition to state the
responsibility for the use of the <code>&lt;add&gt;</code> element, rather than the
responsibility for identifying the hand of the addition.  It may also be
that one editor may make an electronic transcription of another editor's
printed transcription of a manuscript text — here, one will wish to
assign layers of responsibility, so as to allow the reader to determine
exactly what in the final machine-readable transcription was the
responsibility of each editor.  In these complex cases of divided
editorial responsibility for and certainty concerning the content,
attributes and application of a particular element, the more general
mechanisms for representing certainty and responsibility described in
chapter <a class="link_ptr" href="CE.html" title="17">14  Certainty and Responsibility</a> should be used.</p><p><span id="id2522093"/>The fields of reference of the <span class="att">resp</span> and <span class="att">cert</span>
attributes for each element have been chosen to enable what are felt as
the most frequent likely statements an encoder may wish to make
concerning the areas of responsibility and certainty related to that
element.  It is open to each local transcription scheme to vary the use
of the <span class="att">resp</span> and <span class="att">cert</span> attributes on particular
elements where it is felt convenient.  This practice should be
documented in the <code>&lt;encodingDesc&gt;</code> element in the file header.
Further, it is recommended that before interchange any such local usage
of these attributes be converted to conformancy with the definitions of
the <span class="att">resp</span> and <span class="att">cert</span> attributes given in these
<i>Guidelines</i>.  Use of the <span class="att">resp</span> and
<span class="att">cert</span> in interchange documents in ways not here defined may
lead to unpredictable results.</p><div class="p"><span id="id2522145"/>It should be noted that the certainty and responsibility mechanisms
described in chapter <a class="link_ptr" href="CE.html" title="17">14  Certainty and Responsibility</a> replicate all the functions of the
<span class="att">resp</span> and <span class="att">cert</span> attributes on particular elements.
For example, the encoding of Donaldson's conjectured emendation of
wight to wright in line 117 of Chaucer's
<i>Wife of Bath's Prologue</i> (see <a class="link_ptr" href="PH.html#PHCC" title="Correction and Conjecture">15.1.3  Correction and Conjecture</a>) may be
encoded as follows using the <span class="att">resp</span> and <span class="att">cert</span>
attributes on the <code>&lt;corr&gt;</code> element:
<div class="pre"> <span class="element">&lt;choice&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;sic&gt;</span>wight<span class="element">&lt;/sic&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;corr <span class="attribute">resp</span>="#ETD" <span class="attribute">cert</span>="70"&gt;</span>wright<span class="element">&lt;/corr&gt;</span><br/> <span class="element">&lt;/choice&gt;</span></div>
Exactly the same information could be conveyed using the certainty
and responsibility mechanisms, as follows:

The choice of which mechanism to use is left to the encoder.  In
transcriptions where only such statements of responsibility and
certainty are made as can be accommodated within the <span class="att">resp</span> and
<span class="att">cert</span> attributes of particular elements, it will be economical
to use the <span class="att">resp</span> and <span class="att">cert</span> attributes of those
elements.  Where many statements of responsibility and certainty are
made which cannot be so accommodated, it may be economical to use the
<code>&lt;respons&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;certainty&gt;</code> elements throughout.</div><p><span id="id2522271"/>The above discussion supposes that in each case an encoder is able to
specify exactly what it is that one wishes to state responsibility for
and certainty about.  Situations may arise when an encoder wishes to
make a statement concerning certainty or responsibility but is unable or
unwilling to specify so precisely the domain of the certainty or
responsibility.  In these cases, the <code>&lt;note&gt;</code> element may be used
with the <span class="att">type</span> attribute set to ‘cert’ or ‘resp’
and the content of the note giving a prose description of the state of
affairs.</p></div><div class="div3" id="PHDA"><h4>15.2.3  Damage, Illegibility, and Supplied Text</h4><div class="p"><span id="id2522307"/>The <code>&lt;gap&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;supplied&gt;</code> elements described above
(section <a class="link_ptr" href="PH.html#PHOM" title="Text Omitted from or Supplied in the Transcription">15.1.7  Text Omitted from or Supplied in the Transcription</a>) should be used with appropriate attributes
where the degree of damage or illegibility in a text is such that
nothing can be read and the text must be either omitted or supplied
either conjecturally or from one or more other sources.  In many cases, however,
despite damage or illegibility, the text may yet be read with reasonable
confidence.  In these cases, the following elements should be used:
<ul class="specList"><li><b>&lt;<a href="ref-damage.html">damage</a>&gt;</b> contains an area of damage to the text witness.<table class="attList"><tr><td class="Attribute">type</td><td colspan="2">classifies the damage according to any convenient typology.</td></tr><tr><td class="Attribute">hand</td><td colspan="2">In the case of damage (deliberate defacement, etc.) assignable

The damage tag with the degree attribute should
only be used where the text may be read with some confidence; text

in letters, minims, inches, or any appropriate unit, where this
cannot be deduced from the contents of the tag.  For example, the
damage may span structural divisions in the text so that the tag must
then be empty of content.</td></tr></table></li><li><b>&lt;<a href="ref-unclear.html">unclear</a>&gt;</b> contains a word, phrase, or passage which cannot be transcribed

manuscript of the Elder Edda.<a class="notelink" href="#Note126"><sup>126</sup></a> Here, the
manuscript of <i>Vóluspá</i> has been damaged
through irregular rubbing so that letters in various places are obscured
and in some cases cannot be read at all.  The existence of the damage
may be registered in general for this leaf by use of the <code>&lt;damage&gt;</code>
element.
<div class="pre"> <span class="element">&lt;damage <span class="attribute">extent</span>="whole leaf" <span class="attribute">agent</span>="rubbing"&gt;</span> ... <span class="element">&lt;/damage&gt;</span></div>
However, in fact the damage crosses structural divisions, so the
<code>&lt;damage&gt;</code> element does not nest properly within the containing
<code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements.  The simplest method to solve this problem is to
split the element into two fragments, one within each structural
division:
<div class="pre"> <span class="element">&lt;p&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;pb <span class="attribute">n</span>="5r"/&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;damage <span class="attribute">agent</span>="rubbing" <span class="attribute">extent</span>="whole leaf"/&gt;</span><br/> <span class="element">&lt;/p&gt;</span><br/> <span class="element">&lt;p&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;damage <span class="attribute">agent</span>="rubbing" <span class="attribute">extent</span>="whole leaf"/&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;pb <span class="attribute">n</span>="5v"/&gt;</span><br/> <span class="element">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div>
For other techniques of handling non-nesting information, see chapter
<a class="link_ptr" href="USE.html#NH" title="31">24.6  Multiple Hierarchies</a>.</div><div class="p"><span id="id2522426"/>In the first line of this leaf, the transcriber may believe that the
last three letters of daga can be read clearly despite
the damage:
<div class="pre">um aldr d <span class="element">&lt;damage&gt;</span>aga<span class="element">&lt;/damage&gt;</span> yndisniota</div></div><div class="p"><span id="id2522442"/>Alternatively, the letters in question may be only imperfectly
legible on account of the damage; this state of affairs may be indicated
simply by using the <code>&lt;unclear&gt;</code> element:
<div class="pre">um aldr d <span class="element">&lt;unclear <span class="attribute">reason</span>="damage"&gt;</span>aga<span class="element">&lt;/unclear&gt;</span> yndisniota</div></div><div class="p"><span id="id2522461"/>If it is desired to supply more information about the kind of
damage, it is also possible to nest an <code>&lt;unclear&gt;</code> element within
the <code>&lt;damage&gt;</code> element:
<div class="pre">um aldr d <span class="element">&lt;damage <span class="attribute">agent</span>="rubbing"&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;unclear&gt;</span>aga<span class="element">&lt;/unclear&gt;</span><br/> <span class="element">&lt;/damage&gt;</span> yndisniota</div></div><div class="p"><span id="id2522484"/>Alternatively, the transcriber may not feel able to read the last
three letters of daga but may wish to supply them by
conjecture. Note the use of the <span class="att">source</span> attribute to assign
the conjecture to Finnur Jónsson:
<div class="pre">um aldr d <span class="element">&lt;supplied <span class="attribute">reason</span>="rubbing" <span class="attribute">source</span>="FJ"&gt;</span>aga<span class="element">&lt;/supplied&gt;</span> yndisniota</div>
The <code>&lt;supplied&gt;</code> element may if desired be enclosed within a
<code>&lt;damage&gt;</code> element:
<div class="pre">um aldr d <span class="element">&lt;damage <span class="attribute">agent</span>="rubbing"&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;supplied <span class="attribute">source</span>="FJ"&gt;</span>aga<span class="element">&lt;/supplied&gt;</span><br/> <span class="element">&lt;/damage&gt;</span> yndisniota</div></div><div class="p"><span id="id2522532"/>Contrast the use of <code>&lt;gap&gt;</code> in the next line, where the
transcriber believes that four letters cannot be read at all because
of the damage:

ne&amp;thorn;an &lt;gap reason="illegible" agent="rubbing" extent="4"/&gt;</div>
As with <code>&lt;supplied&gt;</code>, this <code>&lt;gap&gt;</code> might be enclosed by a
<code>&lt;damage&gt;</code> element.</div><p><span id="id2522558"/>In these examples, various phenomena of illegibility and conjecture
all result from the one cause, an area of damage to the text — rubbing
at various points — which is not continuous in the text, affecting it
at irregular points.  In these cases, the <code>&lt;join&gt;</code> element may be
used to indicate which tagged features are part of the same physical
phenomenon.  (See chapter <a class="link_ptr" href="SA.html" title="14">11  Linking, Segmentation, and Alignment</a> for more details.)</p><div class="p"><span id="id2522576"/>The above examples record imperfect legibility due to damage.  When
imperfect legibility is due to some other reason (typically because the
handwriting is ill-formed), the <code>&lt;unclear&gt;</code> element should be used
without any enclosing <code>&lt;damage&gt;</code> element.  In Robert Southey's
autograph of <i>The Life of Cowper</i>,<a class="notelink" href="#Note127"><sup>127</sup></a> the final six letters

<code>&lt;supplied&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> elements may be closely allied in
their use.  For example, an area of damage in a primary source might
be encoded with any one of the first four of these elements, depending on
how far the damage has affected the readability of the text.
Further, certain of the elements may nest within one another. The
examples given in the last sections illustrate something of how these
elements are to be distinguished in use.  This may be formulated as
follows:
<ul><li>where the text has been rendered completely illegible by
deletion or damage and no text is supplied by the editor in place of
what is lost: place an empty <code>&lt;gap&gt;</code> element at the point of
deletion or damage.  Use the <span class="att">reason</span> attribute to state the
cause (damage, deletion, etc.) of the loss of text.</li><li>where the text has been rendered completely illegible by
deletion or damage and text is supplied by the editor in place of
what is lost: surround the text supplied at the point of deletion or
damage with the <code>&lt;supplied&gt;</code> element.  Use the <span class="att">reason</span>
attribute to state the cause (damage, deletion, etc.) of the loss of
text leading to the need to supply the text.</li><li>where the text has been rendered partly illegible by deletion
or damage so that the text can be read but without perfect
confidence: transcribe the text and surround it with the
<code>&lt;unclear&gt;</code> element.  Use the <span class="att">reason</span> attribute to state
the cause (damage, deletion, etc.) of the uncertainty in transcription
and the <span class="att">cert</span> attribute to indicate the confidence in the
transcription.</li><li>where there is deletion or damage but the text can be read with
perfect confidence: transcribe the text and surround it with the
<code>&lt;del&gt;</code> element (for deletion) or the <code>&lt;damage&gt;</code> element (for
damage).  Use appropriate attribute values to indicate the cause and
type of deletion or damage.  Observe that the <span class="att">degree</span>
attribute on the <code>&lt;damage&gt;</code> element permits the encoding to show
that a letter, word or phrase is not perfectly preserved, though it
may be read with confidence.</li><li>where there is an area of deletion or damage and parts of the
text within that area can be read with perfect confidence, other
parts with less confidence, other parts not at all: in transcription,
surround the whole area  with the <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> element (for deletion; or
the <code>&lt;delSpan&gt;</code> element where it crosses a structural boundary); or
the <code>&lt;damage&gt;</code> element (for damage).  Text within the damaged area
which can be read with perfect confidence needs no further tagging.
Text within the damaged area which can not be read with perfect
confidence may be surrounded with the <code>&lt;unclear&gt;</code> element.  Places
within the damaged area where the text has been rendered completely
illegible and no text is supplied by the editor may be marked with
the <code>&lt;gap&gt;</code> element. For each element, one may use appropriate
attribute values to indicate the cause and type of deletion or damage
and the certainty of the reading.</li></ul></div><div class="p"><span id="id2523272"/>The rules for combinations of the <code>&lt;add&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;del&gt;</code>
elements, and for the interpretation of such combinations, are
similar:
<ul><li>if one <code>&lt;add&gt;</code> element (with identifier <strong>ADD1</strong>)
contains another (with identifier <strong>ADD2</strong>), then
the addition <strong>ADD1</strong> was first
made to the text, and later a second addition (<strong>ADD2</strong>) was
made within that added text:
<div class="pre">This is the text
 <span class="element">&lt;add <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="ADD1"&gt;</span>with some added

contains another (with identifier <strong>DEL2</strong>), then
the deletion <strong>DEL2</strong> was first
made, and later a second deletion (<strong>DEL1</strong>)
removed the entire passage:
<div class="pre"> <span class="element">&lt;del <span class="attribute">n</span>="DEL1"&gt;</span>This sentence contains
some <span class="element">&lt;del <span class="attribute">n</span>="DEL2"&gt;</span>redundant<span class="element">&lt;/del&gt;</span> unnecessary<br/> verbiage.<span class="element">&lt;/del&gt;</span></div></li><li>if a <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> element contains an <code>&lt;add&gt;</code> element, the normal
interpretation will be that an addition was made within a passage
which was later
deleted in its entirety:
<div class="pre"> <span class="element">&lt;del&gt;</span>This sentence was deleted
<span class="element">&lt;add&gt;</span>originally<span class="element">&lt;/add&gt;</span> from the text.<span class="element">&lt;/del&gt;</span></div></li><li>if an <code>&lt;add&gt;</code> element contains a <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> element, the
normal interpretation will be that a
deletion was made from  a passage which had earlier been added:
<div class="pre"> <span class="element">&lt;add&gt;</span>This sentence was added
<span class="element">&lt;del&gt;</span>eventually<span class="element">&lt;/del&gt;</span> to the text.<span class="element">&lt;/add&gt;</span></div></li></ul></div></div><div class="div3" id="PHSP"><h4>15.2.5  Space</h4><div class="p"><span id="id2523422"/>The presence of significant space in the text being transcribed may
be indicated by the <code>&lt;space&gt;</code> element.  The author or scribe may
have left space for a word, or for an initial capital, and for some
reason the word or capital was never supplied and the space left empty.
This element should not be used to mark normal inter-word space or the
like.

the Holkham manuscript the scribe has left a space for a word where
other manuscripts read preestes:
<div class="pre">By god if wommen had writen storyes
As  <span class="element">&lt;space <span class="attribute">extent</span>="7"/&gt;</span> han within her oratoryes</div>
The <code>&lt;supplied&gt;</code> element discussed in the previous section may be
used to supply the text presumed missing:
<div class="pre">By god if wommen had writen storyes
As  <span class="element">&lt;supplied <span class="attribute">reason</span>="space" <span class="attribute">resp</span>="#ES" <span class="attribute">source</span>="Hg"&gt;</span>preestes<span class="element">&lt;/supplied&gt;</span><br/>han within her oratoryes</div>
Here, the fact of the space within the manuscript is indicated by the
value of the <span class="att">reason</span> attribute.  The source of the supplied
text is shown by the value of the <span class="att">source</span> attribute as the
Hengwrt manuscript; the transcriber responsible for supplying the text
is ES.
The <code>&lt;space&gt;</code> element is formally defined thus:
<div class="specgrp"><span id="DPHSP"/><b>Specification group 124: Spaces in the source</b><dl><dt>Element space</dt><dd><pre class="eg">
space = element space { space.content, space.attributes }

space.content = empty

space.attributes =
   attribute dim { "horizontal" | "vertical" }?,
   attribute extent { list { <a class="link_odd" href="ref-data.word.html">data.word</a>+ } }?,
   attribute resp { <a class="link_odd" href="ref-data.pointer.html">data.pointer</a> }?</pre></dd></dl></div></div></div><div class="div3" id="PHLN"><h4>15.2.6  Lines</h4><div class="p"><span id="id2523766"/>The most common form of marking of text in manuscripts is by lines
written under, beside or through the text.  The lines themselves may be
of various types:  they may be solid, dashed or dotted, doubled or
tripled, wavy or straight, or a combination of these and other
renderings.  The line may be used for emphasis, or to mark a foreign or
technical term, or to signal a quotation or a title, etc.:  the elements
<code>&lt;emph&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;foreign&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;term&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;mentioned&gt;</code>,
<code>&lt;title&gt;</code> may be used for these.  Frequently, a scholar may judge
that a line is used to delete text:  the <code>&lt;del&gt;</code> element is
available to indicate this.  In all these cases, the <span class="att">rend</span>
attribute may be used on these or other elements to indicate that the
text is marked by a line and the style of the line.  Thus, Lawrence's
deletion by strike-through of my in the autograph of
<i>Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani</i> is noted:
<div class="pre">For I hate this
 <span class="element">&lt;del <span class="attribute">rend</span>="strikethrough" <span class="attribute">hand</span>="#dhl"&gt;</span>my<span class="element">&lt;/del&gt;</span> body,<br/>which is so dear to me</div></div><div class="p"><span id="id2523826"/>There will be instances, however, where a scholar wishes only to
register the occurrence of lines in the text, without making any
judgement as to what the lines signify.  In these the <code>&lt;hi&gt;</code>
element may be used, with the <span class="att">rend</span> attribute to mark the
style of line.  In the manuscript of a letter by Robert Browning to
George Moulton-Barrett,<a class="notelink" href="#Note128"><sup>128</sup></a> the
underlining of the phrase had obtained all the letters to Mr Boyd
may be marked-up as follows:
<div class="pre">I have once — by declaring I would prosecute
by law — hindered a man's proceedings who
 <span class="element">&lt;hi <span class="attribute">rend</span>="underline"&gt;</span>had obtained all the letters
to Mr Boyd<span class="element">&lt;/hi&gt;</span></div></div><div class="p"><span id="id2523864"/>The above examples presume the common case where a single word or
phrase is marked by a line, with no doubt as to where the marking begins
or ends and with no overlapping of the area of text with other marked
areas of text.  Where there is doubt, the <code>&lt;certainty&gt;</code> element may
be used to record the doubt.  In the Browning example cited above the
underlining actually begins half-way under who, and this
uncertainty could be remarked as follows:
<div class="pre">I have once — by declaring I would prosecute
by law — hindered a man's proceedings who
 <span class="element">&lt;hi <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="cstart1" <span class="attribute">rend</span>="underline"&gt;</span>had obtained all
the letters to Mr Boyd<span class="element">&lt;/hi&gt;</span><br/>&lt;!-- ... --&gt;<br/> <span class="element">&lt;certainty <span class="attribute">target</span>="cstart1" <span class="attribute">locus</span>="#startloc" <span class="attribute">degree</span>="0.70"&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;desc&gt;</span>may begin with previous word<span class="element">&lt;/desc&gt;</span><br/> <span class="element">&lt;/certainty&gt;</span></div></div><p><span id="id2523912"/>Where the area of text marked overlaps other areas of text, for
example crossing a structural division, one of the span mechanisms
outlined in these Guidelines may be used.  Where the line is thought to
mark a deletion, the <code>&lt;delSpan&gt;</code> element may be used.  Where it is
desired simply to record the marking of a span of text in circumstances
where it is not possible to surround the text with a <code>&lt;hi&gt;</code>
element, the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> element may be used with the <span class="att">rend</span>
attribute indicating the style of line-marking.</p><p><span id="id2523938"/>More work needs to be done on clarifying the treatment of other
textual features marked by lines which might so overlap or nest.  For
example, in many Middle English manuscripts (e.g. the Jesus and Digby
verse collections) marginal sidebars may indicate metrical structure:
couplets may be linked in pairs, with the pairs themselves linked
into stanzas. Or, marginal sidebars may indicate emphasis, or may
point out a region of text on which there is some annotation: in many
manuscripts of Chaucer's <i>Wife of Bath's Prologue</i> lines
655–8 are marked with nesting parentheses against which the scribe
has written nota.</p><p><span id="id2523969"/>At the lowest level, all such features could be captured by use of
the <code>&lt;note&gt;</code> element, containing a prose description of the
manuscript at this point.  It is not yet clear how best to mark up such
phenomena so as to
obtain more usefully structured encodings.  For example,
in the Chaucer example just cited, one may wish to record that the
nota is written in the Hengwrt manuscript in the right
margin against a single large left parenthesis bracketing the four
lines, with two right parentheses in the right margin bracketing two
overlapping pairs of lines:  the first and third, the second and fourth.
The <code>&lt;note&gt;</code> element allows us to record that the scribe wrote
nota, but is not well-adapted to show that the
nota points both at all four lines and at two pairs of
lines within the four lines.  </p></div></div><div class="div2" id="PHSK"><h3>15.3  Headers, Footers, and Similar Matter</h3><div class="p"><span id="id2524014"/>As a rule, matter associated with the page break (signature,
catchword, page number) should be drawn into the <code>&lt;pb&gt;</code> element
as attributes:  see section <a class="link_ptr" href="CO.html#CORS" title="Reference Systems">4.10  Reference Systems</a>.  In text-critical
situations where these elements need tagging in their own right (for
instance, when the catch-word presents a variant reading, or spacing
in the header or footer is significant for compositor identification),
the element <code>&lt;fw&gt;</code> may be used:
<ul class="specList"><li><b>&lt;<a href="ref-fw.html">fw</a>&gt;</b> (forme work) contains a running head (e.g. a header, footer), catchword, or
  similar material appearing on the current page.</li></ul>
The name fw is short for ‘forme work’. It
may be used  to encode any of
the unchanging portions of a page forme, such as:
<ul><li>running heads (whether repeated on every page, or changing on
every page)</li><li>running footers</li><li>page numbers</li><li>catch-words</li><li>other material repeated from page to page, which falls outside the
stream of the text</li></ul>
It should not be used for marginal glosses, annotations, or textual
variants, which should be tagged using <code>&lt;gloss&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;note&gt;</code>, or

these recommendations are not intended to meet every transcriptional
circumstance ever likely to be faced by any scholar.  They are intended
rather as a base to enable encoding of the most common phenomena found
in the course of scholarly transcription of primary source materials.
These guidelines particularly do not address the encoding of physical
description of textual witnesses:  the materials of the carrier, the
medium of the inscribing implement, the layout of the inscription upon
the material, the organisation of the carrier materials themselves (as
quiring, collation, etc.), authorial instructions or scribal markup,
etc.  Some of these issues may be covered in future editions of these
guidelines.</p></div><p class="left"><i> Up: </i><a class="navigation" href="index.html">Contents</a><i> Previous: </i><a class="navigation" href="CE.html">14  Certainty and Responsibility</a><i> Next: </i><a class="navigation" href="TC.html">16  Critical Apparatus</a></p><div class="notes"><div class="noteHeading">Notes</div><div class="note"><a id="Note114">114.</a>From <span id="index-bibl-id2517616"/>‘The Manere of
