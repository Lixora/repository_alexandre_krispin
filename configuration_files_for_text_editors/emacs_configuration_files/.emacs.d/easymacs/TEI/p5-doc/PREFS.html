order) the ‘Introductory Notes’ prefixed to each 
revision of the TEI Guidelines since its first publication in 1994. 
</i></p></blockquote><div class="teidiv1" id="p4pf01"><h3>Appendix F.1  Introductory Note (November 2001)</h3><p><span id="id2584171"/>To complete the work started in June of this year, the TEI Editors
asked for volunteers from the TEI community to proof-read the preliminary XML
version. 24 volunteers responded to this call during August, and gave invaluable help both by identifying
a number of previously un-noticed errors, and by suggesting areas in
which more substantial revision should be undertaken in the
future. The Editors gratefully acknowledge the assistance of the following
individuals during this exercise:

</p><div class="p"><span id="id2584194"/>In addition to error correction, and clear delineation of those sections in
which substantial revision is yet to be undertaken for TEI P5, the
present draft differs from earlier ones in the following respects:
<ul><li>Formal Public Identifiers have been introduced as a means of
constructing TEI DTDs and an SGML Open Catalog is now included with the
standard release; </li><li>Some systematic errors and omissions in the reference section
have been removed; the format of this  section  has been substantially changed, we
hope for the better;</li><li>The chapters on obtaining the TEI DTDs and WSDs have been
brought up to date; the chapter on modification has been expanded to
include a discussion of the TEI Lite customization;</li><li>All examples and cited markup has been checked for XML validity
against the published DTDs, and corrected where faulty; examples have
been formatted in a (more or less) consistent style.</li></ul></div><p class="left">Lou Burnard and Syd Bauman (Editors)</p><p class="left">Oxford and Providence, November 2001.</p></div><div class="teidiv1" id="PPF2"><h3>Appendix F.2  Introductory Note (June 2001)</h3><p><span id="id2584246"/>This is a preliminary version of a revised and fully XML-compliant
edition of the TEI Guidelines. Although work on revising and
correcting the text of the document is incomplete, by making
available this preliminary version we hope to facilitate testing of
the XML document type declarations which it describes by as wide a
range of TEI users as possible. </p><div class="p"><span id="id2584256"/>The primary goal of this revision is to make available the
corrected (May 1999) edition of the Guidelines in a new version which:
<ul><li>is expressed  in XML and itself conforms to a TEI-conformant XML
       DTD;</li><li>generates a set of XML DTD fragments that can be combined
       together in the same way as the existing TEI (P3) SGML DTD
       fragments to form true TEI XML DTD fragments without loss of functionality;</li><li>can be processed and maintained using readily available XML
       tools instead of the special-purpose ad hoc software originally
       used for TEI P3.</li></ul>
As noted elsewhere, a number of errors were corrected in
the May 1999 edition. A (much) smaller number of errors have also been
corrected in this edition, but no new material has been added. We
expect the expansion and modification of the Guidelines to become
a real possibility in the context of the newly formed TEI Consortium,
which has funded the preparation of this present edition.</div><p><span id="id2584288"/>A major design goal of both this and the previous revision has been
      to ensure that the DTD fragments generated would not break
      existing documents: in other words, that any document conforming
      to the original TEI P3 SGML DTD would also conform to the new
      XML version of it. Although full backwards compatibility cannot
     be guaranteed, we believe our implementation is consistent with
      that goal.  </p><p><span id="id2584299"/>In making this new version, we relied extensively on preliminary
      work carried out by the outgoing North American editor of the
      TEI Guidelines, Michael Sperberg-McQueen. In a TEI working paper
      written in 1999, TEI ED
      W69, Michael sketched out a precise blueprint for the
      conversion of the TEI from SGML to XML, which we have
      implemented, with only slight modification. The current TEI
      editors wish to express here our admiration for the detailed
      care put into that paper, without which our task would have been
      forbiddingly difficult, if not impossible. We would also like to
      express our thanks to Sebastian Rahtz of Oxford University
      Computing Services, for his invaluable assistance in preparing
      this new edition.</p><div class="p"><span id="id2584315"/>We list here in summary form all the changes made in the present
edition. Full technical details are provided in documents TEI EDW69
and TEI EDW70, available from the TEI website. 
<ul><li>A new keyword <span class="ident-pe">TEI.XML</span> has been added. By setting
its value to <span class="val">INCLUDE</span>, rather than the default <span class="val">IGNORE</span>,
the user can request generation of an XML rather than an SGML DTD;</li><li>The content models of all elements have been checked, and, where
necessary, changed so that they are equally valid as SGML or as
XML; </li><li>The declared value for all attributes has been changed to a form
which is equally valid as SGML or as XML;</li><li>All the examples have been checked for conformance and converted to
use XML syntax, where possible. (This process is currently incomplete.)</li><li>Some errors and duplications in the class
membership of elements from the names and dates tagsets have been corrected. </li></ul></div><p><span id="id2584365"/>To implement the first of these, we have parameterized the
<em>tag omissibility</em> indicators ‘- o’ and ‘- -’
used within element declarations in the DTD. When XML is to be
generated, the parameter entities concerned are redeclared with the null
string as their value. </p><p><span id="id2584383"/>The second change was achieved by removing SGML-specific features
(ampersand connectors, inclusion and exclusion exceptions, various
types of attribute content) from the DTD and revising the syntax of
the DTD to conform to XML requirements (specifically in the
representation of mixed-content models, and by removing redundant
parentheses). In making these changes, we took care to ensure that the
resulting content model would continue to accept existing valid
documents, though in the nature of things it could not be guaranteed
to reject the same set of documents. As further discussed in EDW69 and
EDW70, some constraints (exclusion exceptions, for example) which
could be carried out by a generic SGML parser using TEI P3 will have
to be implemented by a special purpose TEI validator using TEI
P4. </p><p><span id="id2584400"/>Much work remains to be done, firstly in testing the new DTD
fragments against as wide a range of TEI materials as possible,
secondly in revising the discussion of markup theory and practice
within the text to reflect current thinking. A few sections of the
current text (the Gentle Introduction to SGML and the discussion of
Extended Pointer syntax are two examples) will need substantial
rewriting. For the most part, however, we think the Guidelines have
stood the test of time well and can be recommended to a new generation of
text encoders scarcely born at the time they were first formulated.
</p><p><span id="id2584413"/>Lou Burnard and Steve De Rose (Editors)</p><p><span id="id2584417"/>Oxford and Providence, May 2001.</p></div><div class="section" id="ppf"><h3>Appendix F.3  Introductory Note (May 1999)</h3><p><span id="id2584434"/>No work of the size and complexity of the TEI
<i>Guidelines</i> could reasonably be expected to be error-free on
publication, nor to remain long uncorrected. It has however taken rather longer
than might have been anticipated to complete production of the present
corrected reprint of the first edition, for which we present our apologies,
both to the many individuals and institutions whose enthusiastic adoption and
promotion of the TEI encoding scheme have ensured its continued survival in the
rapidly changing world of digital scholarship, and also to the many helpfully
critical users whose assiduous uncovering and reporting of our errors have made
possible the present revision. </p><p><span id="id2584452"/>At its first meeting in Bergen, in June 1996, the TEI Technical Review
Committee (TRC) approved the setting up of a small working committee to oversee the
production of a revised edition of the TEI
<i>Guidelines</i>, to include corrections of as many as possible of the
`corrigible errors' notified to the editors since publication
of the first edition in May 1994, the bulk of which are summarized in a TEI
working paper (TEI EDW67, available from the TEI website). </p><p><span id="id2584466"/>During the spring of 1997, this TRC Core Subcommittee reviewed nearly 200
comments and proposals which the editors had collected from public debate and
discussion over the preceding two years, and provided invaluable technical
guidance in disposition of them. We are glad to take this opportunity of
expressing our thanks to this subcommittee, whose members were Elli Mylonas,
Dominic Dunlop, and David T. Barnard. </p><p><span id="id2584476"/>The work of making the corrections and regenerating the text proceeded
  rather fitfully during 1998 and 1999, largely because of increasing demands on
  the editors' time from their other responsibilities. With the
  establishment of the new TEI Consortium, it is be hoped that maintenance of the
  Guidelines will be placed on a more secure footing. Some specific areas in which we
  anticipate future revisions being carried out are listed below. </p><div class="section" id="back.1_div.6_div.3_div.1"><h4>Appendix F.3.1  Typographic corrections made</h4><ul><li>examples of TEI markup throughout the text were all checked against the
	 relevant DTD fragment and an embarassingly large number of tagging errors
	 corrected;</li><li>various minor typographic and spelling errors were corrected;</li><li>the ‘corrigible errors’ listed in working paper TEI EDW67 were all
	 corrected: some of these required specific changes to the DTD which are listed
	 in the next section.</li></ul></div><div class="section" id="back.1_div.6_div.3_div.2"><h4>Appendix F.3.2  Specific changes in the DTD</h4><p><span id="id2584528"/>A major goal of this revision was to avoid changes which might invalidate
  existing data, even where existing constructs seemed erroneous in retrospect.
  To that end, wherever changes have been made in content models for existing
  elements, they have as far as possible been made so that the DTD will now
  accept a superset of what was previously legal. Only one new element
  (<code>&lt;ab&gt;</code>) has been added.</p><p><span id="id2584541"/>Where possible, a few content models have been changed in such a way as to
  facilitate conversion to XML, but XML compatibility is
  <em>not</em> a goal
  of this revision.</p><div class="p"><span id="id2584550"/>Brief details of all changes made in the DTD follow:
<ul><li>Several changes were made in class membership, in order to correct
	 unreachability problems. Specifically:
	 <ul><li>elements <code>&lt;geogName&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;persName&gt;</code>,
		  <code>&lt;placeName&gt;</code> were added to the <span class="ident-class">m.data</span> class; </li><li><code>&lt;geogName&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;placeName&gt;</code> were removed from the
		  <span class="ident-class">m.placepart</span> class;</li><li>the elements <code>&lt;addSpan&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;delSpan&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;gap&gt;</code>, were
		  added to the <span class="ident-class">m.Edit</span> class; </li><li>a new class <span class="ident-class">m.editIncl</span> was defined, with members
		  <code>&lt;addSpan&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;delSpan&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;gap&gt;</code>; this class was then added
		  to the global inclusion class
<span class="ident-class">m.globIncl</span> along with
		  <code>&lt;anchor&gt;</code> (erroneously a member of the
<span class="ident-class">m.Seg</span>  class, from
		  which it is now removed), <span class="ident-class">m.metadata</span> and <span class="ident-class">m.refsys</span>;
		  </li></ul></li><li>added <code>&lt;name&gt;</code> element to <span class="ident-class">m.addrPart</span> class;</li><li>added <code>&lt;dateLine&gt;</code> to <span class="ident-class">m.divtop</span> and 
     <span class="ident-class">m.divbot</span> classes;</li><li>added <code>&lt;epilogue&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;castList&gt;</code> to
     <span class="ident-class">m.dramafront</span> class;</li><li>added <code>&lt;divGen&gt;</code> to <span class="ident-class">m.front</span> class;</li><li>added <code>&lt;dateLine&gt;</code> to <span class="ident-class">m.divtop</span> and
	 <span class="ident-class">m.divtop</span> classes;</li><li>added <code>&lt;u&gt;</code> element to <span class="ident-class">a.declaring</span> class;</li><li>defined new class <span class="ident-class">m.fmchunk</span> (front matter chunk),
	 comprising <code>&lt;argument&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;byline&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;docAuthor&gt;</code>,
	 <code>&lt;docDate&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;docEdition&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;docImprint&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;docTitle&gt;</code>,
	 <code>&lt;epigraph&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;titlePart&gt;</code> for use in
	 simplification of the content model for <code>&lt;front&gt;</code> element;</li><li>defined new element <code>&lt;ab&gt;</code> (anonymous block), and added it to the
	 <span class="ident-class">m.chunk</span> class;</li><li>corrected an error whereby global attributes were not properly defined
	 for elements specifying a non-default value for any of the
	 <span class="ident-class">a.global</span> attributes: elements affected include: <code>&lt;foreign&gt;</code>,
	 <code>&lt;hi&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;del&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;pb&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;lb&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;cb&gt;</code>,
	 <code>&lt;language&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;anchor&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;when&gt;</code>;</li><li>changed content models to permit empty <code>&lt;list&gt;</code> and empty
	 <code>&lt;availability&gt;</code> elements;</li><li>changed content model for <code>&lt;series&gt;</code> element to permit #PCDATA;
  </li><li>changed content model for <code>&lt;setting&gt;</code> element to permit
	 <code>&lt;date&gt;</code> element as a direct child; </li><li>added a <span class="att">key</span> attribute to the <code>&lt;distance&gt;</code> element,
	 for consistency with other elements in its class;</li><li>changed content model for <code>&lt;orgName&gt;</code> element to make it more
	 consistent with e.g. <code>&lt;persname&gt;</code>;</li><li>changed content model for <code>&lt;opener&gt;</code> element to include
	 <code>&lt;argument&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;byLine&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;epigraph&gt;</code>;</li><li>changed content models for <code>&lt;app&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;rdgGrp&gt;</code>, and
	 <code>&lt;wit&gt;</code> elements;</li><li>revised attributes on <code>&lt;hand&gt;</code> element.</li></ul></div><div class="p"><span id="id2584967"/>A number of content models were changed with a view to
easing the creation of an XML compatible version of the
Guidelines. Specifically:
<ul><li> removed ampersand connectors from  <code>&lt;cit&gt;</code>,
<code>&lt;respStmt&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;publicationStmt&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;graph&gt;</code>;</li><li>changed the mixed content models for <code>&lt;sense&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;re&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;persName&gt;</code>,
<code>&lt;placeName&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;geogName&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;dateStruct&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;timeStruct&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;dateLine&gt;</code>
to make them XML-conformant.</li></ul></div></div><div class="section" id="back.1_div.6_div.3_div.3"><h4>Appendix F.3.3  Outstanding errors</h4><p><span id="id2585033"/>A small number of other known problems remain uncorrected in this version
  and are briefly listed below. Please watch the TEI mailing list for
  announcements of their correction.</p><ul><li>elements of class <span class="ident-class">inter</span> don't always behave
        as they should (e.g. one cannot insert a <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> before
        anything else in a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>);
  </li><li>some mixed-content problems consequent on the definition of
         <span class="ident-class">macro.specialPara</span> need to be addressed systematically;
         in particular, the treatment of list items or notes which contain
         several paragraphs continues to surprise many users:  no white
         space is allowed between the paragraphs;</li><li>the <span class="att">resp</span> attributes on editorial elements are not
         consistently defined; </li><li>the discussions of DTD invocation, and the DTD itself, all use
        system identifiers instead of formal public identifiers.</li></ul><p><span id="id2585089"/>Our next priority however will be the production of a fully XML-compliant version
  of the TEI DTD, work on which is already well advanced.</p><p class="left">C.M. Sperberg McQueen and Lou Burnard, May 1999</p></div></div><div class="Preface" id="PF"><h3>Appendix F.4  Preface (April 1994)</h3><p><span id="id2585112"/>These Guidelines are the result of over five years' effort by
members of the research and academic community within the
framework of an international cooperative project called the Text
Encoding Initiative (TEI), established in 1987 under the joint
sponsorship of the Association for Computers and the Humanities,
the Association for Computational Linguistics, and the Association
for Literary and Linguistic Computing.
 </p><p><span id="id2585122"/>The impetus for the project came from the humanities computing
community, which sought a common encoding scheme for complex textual
structures in order to reduce the diversity of existing encoding
practices, simplify processing by machine, and encourage the sharing of
electronic texts. It soon became apparent that a sufficiently flexible
scheme could provide solutions for text encoding problems generally. The
scope of the TEI was therefore broadened to meet the varied encoding
requirements of any discipline or application. Thus, the TEI became the
only systematized attempt to develop a fully general text encoding model
and set of encoding conventions based upon it, suitable for processing
and analysis of any type of text, in any language, and intended to serve
the increasing range of existing (and potential) applications and use.
 </p><p><span id="id2585139"/>What is published here is a major milestone in this effort. It
provides a single, coherent framework for all kinds of text encoding
which is hardware-, software- and application-independent. Within this
framework, it specifies encoding conventions for a number of key text
types and features. The ongoing work of the TEI is to extend the
scheme presented here to cover additional text types and features, as
well as to continue to refine its encoding recommendations on the
basis of extensive experience with their actual application and use.
 </p><p><span id="id2585161"/>We therefore offer these Guidelines to the user community for use in
the same spirit of active collaboration and cooperation with which
they have so far been developed. The TEI is committed to actively
supporting the wide-spread and large-scale use of the Guidelines
which, with the publication of this volume, is now for the first time
possible. In addition, we anticipate that users of the TEI Guidelines
will in some instances adapt and extend them as necessary to suit
particular needs; we invite such users to engage in the further
development of the Guidelines by working with us as they do so.
 </p><p><span id="id2585174"/>Like any standard which is actually used, these Guidelines do not
represent a static finished work, but rather one which will evolve
over time with the active involvement of its community of users. We
invite and encourage the participation of the the user community in
this process, in order to ensure that the TEI Guidelines become and
remain useful in all sorts of work with machine-readable texts.

in November 1990, a number of specialist work groups were charged with
responsibility for drafting revisions and extensions, which, together
with material already presented in P1, constitute the basis of the
present work.</p><div class="p"><span id="id2585419"/>In addition, many members of the work groups listed below met on
three occasions to review the emerging proposals in detail at
technical review meetings convened by the TEI Steering Committee.
These meetings, held in Myrdal, Norway (November 1991), Chicago (May
1992) and Oxford (May 1993), were largely responsible for the
technical content and organization of the present work.  Attendants at
these meetings are starred in the list below.
