the next release.</i></p></blockquote><div class="p"><span id="id2575488"/>The notion of <em>TEI conformance</em>
is intended as an aid in describing the
format and contents of a particular document or set of documents.
These concepts are expected to be useful in:
<ul><li>agreements for the interchange of documents among researchers</li><li>agreements for the deposit of texts in archives and their
distribution from archives</li><li>describing the documents to be produced by or for a given project</li><li>defining the classes of documents accepted or rejected by a given
piece of software</li></ul></div><p><span id="id2575520"/>This chapter describes the areas in which these terms are defined and
specifies their meaning.  It also proposes other terms for related
concepts and points out some dangers in the careless use or application
of these terms.</p><div class="div2" id="CFDEFNS"><h4>24.1.1  Definitions of Terms</h4><p><span id="id2575540"/>The terms described here should be considered technical terms for
users and implementors of the TEI Guidelines and should be used only in
the senses given and with the usages described.</p><div class="div3" id="CFDOC"><h5>24.1.1.1  TEI-Conformant Document</h5><p><span id="id2575559"/>A document is <em>TEI-conformant</em> if it is
either in <em>TEI local processing format</em> or in <em>TEI
interchange format</em>.  A full description of the document should
specify which format it is in.</p><p><span id="id2575577"/>The term <em>TEI conformance</em> does not apply to software:
programs can be usefully described as <em>accepting</em> or
<em>validating</em> TEI-conformant documents or some subset of
TEI-conformant documents, but the TEI defines no required processing
model against which software could be measured.  Programs are thus not
themselves conformant or non-conformant and should not be so described.</p></div><div class="div3" id="CFLOCAL"><h5>24.1.1.2  TEI Local Processing Format</h5><div class="p"><span id="id2575610"/>A document is in <em>TEI local processing format</em> if
<ul><li>it is a valid XML document;</li><li>or, alternatively, it is a conforming SGML document with an appropriate legal SGML declaration;</li><li>it uses the document type declarations provided by the TEI, either
without modifications or with all modifications effected by inclusion
in the DTD subset as described in section <a class="link_ptr" href="USE.html#DTDMOD" title="Modifications to TEI Document Type Declarations">24.1.3  Modifications to TEI Document Type Declarations</a>;</li><li>all modifications to meaning or use of defined tags, and all new
tags, are documented in TEI Tag Set Declarations which accompany the
document, as defined in chapter <a class="link_ptr" href="TD.html" title="27">23  Documentation Elements</a>;
	</li><li>it includes, in the TEI header, all the elements required by the
TEI declarations for the TEI header;</li><li>it contains no non-SGML, non-XML markup other than declared notations for
graphics, tables, figures, etc.  That is, unless a declared notation is
in use, the semantics of any content character in the document are
exhausted by its identity as a graphic character.</li></ul></div><p><span id="id2575664"/>A TEI-local-processing-format document may be described as requiring
<em>DTD extensions</em> if it modifies the TEI-supplied DTDs (or in
the case of SGML, the
SGML prolog) in any of the ways described  under <a class="link_ptr" href="USE.html#DTDMOD" title="Modifications to TEI Document Type Declarations">24.1.3  Modifications to TEI Document Type Declarations</a>.</p><p><span id="id2575679"/>The following terms are synonymous:  <em>document in TEI local
processing format</em>, <em>TEI local-processing document</em>,
and <em>TEI local-processing-conformant document</em>.</p></div><div class="div3" id="CFINT"><h5>24.1.1.3  TEI Interchange Format</h5><div class="p"><span id="id2575708"/>A document is in <em>TEI interchange format</em> if it conforms
to the TEI local-processing format and if further:
<ul><li>it is valid XML; or is SGML using either the predefined SGML
declaration for TEI interchange documents or one
which differs from it only in ways allowed by section <a class="link_ptr" href="USE.html#SGMLMOD" title="Modifications to TEI SGML Declaration">24.1.2  Modifications to TEI SGML Declaration</a>;</li><li>it makes no use of any of the following SGML constructs:<a class="notelink" href="#Note150"><sup>150</sup></a><ul><li>short references</li><li>the RANK feature</li><li>omission of generic identifiers in start- and end-tags<a class="notelink" href="#Note151"><sup>151</sup></a></li><li>keywords other than INCLUDE, IGNORE, and CDATA on a marked
section</li></ul></li><li>it includes no SUBDOC subordinate document by means of an entity
reference embedded directly within content data (SUBDOCs must be
included by giving the entity reference as the value of an attribute);</li><li>it does not provide different definitions for the same entity in
different document types.</li></ul></div><p><span id="id2575787"/>A TEI-interchange-format document may be described as requiring
<em>DTD extensions</em> if its DTD is modified in any of the ways
described in section <a class="link_ptr" href="USE.html#DTDMOD" title="Modifications to TEI Document Type Declarations">24.1.3  Modifications to TEI Document Type Declarations</a>.</p><p><span id="id2575801"/>The following terms are synonymous: <em>document in TEI
interchange format</em>, <em>TEI interchange document</em>, and
<em>TEI interchange-conformant document</em>.</p></div><div class="div3" id="CFEX"><h5>24.1.1.4  TEI Packed Interchange format</h5><div class="p"><span id="id2575830"/>A document is in TEI packed interchange format with a given
<em>transmission character set</em> and a given
<em>transmission entity set</em> if all of the following are true:
<ul><li>all separate entities in the document are packed into a single
entity (file) in a manner conforming to ISO 9069 (SDIF) or to some
other TEI-authorized form;</li><li>all characters occurring in SGML or XML names (generic identifiers and
attribute names) occur within the transmission character set;
	</li><li>all characters in the document content and attribute values either
occur within the transmission character set or are represented by an
appropriate entity reference using an entity name included in the
transmission entity set;</li><li>the transmission character and entity sets are named in the header
of the packed file and in any  accompanying paper documentation.</li></ul>
Any
pre-transmission processing required to convert a document to meet the
above requirements for conformance to the  TEI-interchange-format  is
called <em>packing</em>.</div><p><span id="id2575879"/>With prior agreement between parties to an exchange, interchange
documents may use character code set switching as defined in ISO 2022, its
national analogues, or successor standards.</p><p><span id="id2575886"/>A full description of a document in TEI packed interchange format
<em>must</em> specify the transmission character set and the
transmission entity set used in the document.</p></div><div class="div3" id="CFREC"><h5>24.1.1.5  TEI Recommended Practice</h5><div class="p"><span id="id2575909"/>A document follows <em>TEI recommended practice</em> if:
<ul><li>it is a TEI-conformant document;</li><li>wherever the guidelines say to prefer one encoding practice to
another, the preferred practice is used;</li><li>all textual features which the guidelines recommend be captured
are in fact encoded.
	</li></ul></div></div><div class="div3" id="CFMOD"><h5>24.1.1.6  TEI Abstract Model</h5><p><span id="id2575946"/>A document follows the <em>TEI abstract model</em> if it tags
the features specified in the TEI documentation and documentation, and
their structural interrelations agree with those specified in the TEI DTDs.
</p></div></div><div class="div2" id="SGMLMOD"><h4>24.1.2  Modifications to TEI SGML Declaration</h4><div class="p"><span id="id2575969"/>The effective SGML declaration cannot be changed when using XML.
When using SGML, the SGML declaration for TEI interchange documents may differ
from that provided in TEI documentation in these ways:
<ul><li>the CHARSET clause must be used to define the transmission character set
(possibly in connection with the SHUNCHAR specification in the SYNTAX clause);</li><li>the CAPACITY clause may  be used to raise (but not lower) capacities;</li><li>the SYNTAX clause may be used to define the SGML syntax used in
      the document.  Notably:
<ul><li>the SHUNCHAR specification within the SYNTAX clause may be used to
restrict the transmission character set;</li><li>the BASESET and DESCSET specifications within the SYNTAX
clause must be used to describe the transmission character set;</li><li>the DELIM and NAMES specifications may be used to modify the SGML
syntax. In particular, for consistency between SGML and XML, the NAMECASE specification may 
(perhaps even should) 
be used to set GENERAL NO, making SGML names case-sensitive; and the DELIM specification
may (perhaps even should) 
be used to set NET to "/&gt;", making SGML and XML EMPTY elements compatible;</li></ul></li><li>in the FEATURES clause, CONCUR may be set to NO if concurrent
markup is not used in the document.</li></ul></div><div class="p"><span id="id2576028"/>The following portions of the SGML declaration may not be modified in
TEI interchange documents:
<ul><li>the CAPACITY and QUANTITY values may be increased but not decreased;</li><li>the SCOPE clause may not be changed;</li><li>no new FEATURES may be turned on.</li></ul></div><p><span id="id2576050"/>The SGML declaration for TEI-local-format documents may be modified
without restriction.  Some recommendations for usage are made in
document TEI P1, but these recommendations are not normative.</p></div><div class="div2" id="DTDMOD"><h4>24.1.3  Modifications to TEI Document Type Declarations</h4><div class="p"><span id="id2576069"/>A TEI-conformant document (whether for local processing or for
interchange) may make any change to the TEI-supplied document type
declarations which is allowed by SGML and the controlling SGML
declaration.  All such changes should be made (or at least it must
be possible to make them) within the SGML DTD subset, by defining TEI
DTD modifications files as described in chapter <a class="link_ptr" href="USE.html#MD" title="29">24.2  Modifying and Customizing the TEI DTD</a>,
and embedding the modification files within the DTD subset of a
document whose document type declaration refers to the unmodified TEI
main DTD, as in the following fragment:<div class="pre_eg">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE TEI PUBLIC "-//TEI P5//DTD Main Document Type//EN"
                       "tei2.dtd" [
  &lt;!ENTITY % TEI.extensions.ent
    PUBLIC "-//ProjectName//ENTITIES Local modifications to TEI main DTD//EN"
           "project.ent"&gt;
  &lt;!ENTITY % TEI.extensions.dtd
    PUBLIC "-//ProjectName//DTD Local element types for TEI main DTD//EN"
           "project.dtd"&gt;
]&gt;</div></div><p><span id="id2576090"/>For reasons of convenience, it may be desirable in practice to
create a <em>derived DTD</em> in which the local modifications
have been integrated with the TEI main DTD in a single file.  If such
a  one-file DTD is desired, it should be derived automatically from
the TEI DTD and the local modifications files using appropriate
software, rather than derived by hand-editing the TEI DTD files, as
hand-editing increases the chances of error and inconsistency between
the DTD modifications files and the one-file DTD. Documents in the TEI
interchange format must use the form shown above, with a reference to
the unmodified main TEI DTD and declarations of the local
modifications files.</p><div class="p"><span id="id2576123"/>The following must remain true of the DTD after modification:
<ul><li>the overall document must contain a single <code>&lt;teiHeader&gt;</code>
element and a single <code>&lt;text&gt;</code> element, in that order; in the
case of a corpus or collection the overall collection may have a
<code>&lt;teiHeader&gt;</code> followed by a series of <code>&lt;tei&gt;</code> documents;</li><li>the <code>&lt;teiHeader&gt;</code> element must include elements for:
<dl><dt>title statement</dt><dd>the title of the machine-readable work and the names of those
responsible for it;</dd><dt>publication statement</dt><dd>place and date of publication or distribution of the machine-readable
document;</dd><dt>source description</dt><dd>bibliographic description of the copy text or source of the
electronic text, including at least title, author,
        and edition.</dd></dl></li></ul></div><div class="p"><span id="id2576185"/>A TEI-conformant document may be said to require <em>DTD
extensions</em> if it:
<ul><li>defines new elements;</li><li>modifies the content model, declared content, or omissibility of any
element;</li><li>adds or modifies any attribute definitions;</li><li>renames any elements, attributes, or attribute values;</li><li>defines any new document types;</li><li>declares any non-SGML, non-XML notations.</li></ul>
Without requiring DTD extensions, therefore, any TEI document may:
<ul><li>define entities and parameter entities;</li><li>include processing instructions and comments in its DTD subset.</li></ul>
For local-processing purposes, a TEI document may also, without
requiring DTD extension:
<ul><li>include link type declarations etc. in its SGML prolog;</li><li>define and use short reference mapping in its DTD.</li></ul>
Note that TEI interchange documents may <em>not</em> include link
type or short reference declarations because the SGML declaration for
interchange does not allow them (nor does XML).</div><p><span id="id2576258"/>It is expected that the notion of DTD extension will be particularly
useful in describing the classes of documents accepted or
validated by software.</p></div><div class="div2" id="PROCMOD"><h4>24.1.4  TEI Processing Model</h4><p><span id="id2576276"/>This section is included for illustrative purposes only; it does
not restrict the processing of TEI or other documents.  It simply
distinguishes a number of typical ways in which a project may choose
to apply the TEI Guidelines to different kinds of processing.</p><div class="div3" id="PMDOC"><h5>24.1.4.1  Document Capture and Reclamation</h5><p><span id="id2576297"/>First, data might be captured by keyboarding into a locally defined
data capture format, or by scanning into a locally defined scanner-file
format.  From these initial forms, transducers might convert the files
into a standard local storage format.</p></div><div class="div3" id="PMLOCAL"><h5>24.1.4.2  Local Storage Format and Application Software</h5><p><span id="id2576318"/>The local storage format might be the input format of some
application program used frequently by the project.  In this case,
transducers might be necessary to prepare data for processing by other
applications.  Alternatively, the local storage format might be
independent of the formats used by application programs; transducers
would be needed to prepare data for any processing.  Such an
independent format is useful if the local storage format needs to
contain more information than any single application can conveniently
handle.</p><p><span id="id2576331"/>The local storage format might be SGML- or XML-conformant without being
TEI-conformant, e.g. because it uses local DTDs instead of the standard
TEI DTDs, or because it uses a TEI local processing format.  Local
software may be used to validate a TEI
local-processing format, to transduce documents into the input formats
needed by applications, and when appropriate to transform documents
into the TEI interchange format for exchange with other sites.</p><p><span id="id2576342"/>Finally, the TEI interchange format may be used as a local storage
format.  It is not expected that this will be a very common practice,
since it is expected that most sites interested in TEI conformance
will eventually acquire markup-aware software which have advantages of
compactness or processing.  In the
absence of such software, however, some projects may find the TEI
interchange format (or perhaps a restrictive variant of it) useful,
because such a format can be relatively easy to parse with ad hoc
software.</p><p><span id="id2576355"/>Whether the local storage format is strictly TEI conformant or not,
it may follow TEI-recommended practice in its selection of textual
features to be marked up, in its tag names, in its documentation
practices, etc.</p></div><div class="div3" id="PMRICH"><h5>24.1.4.3  Enrichment and Other Processing</h5><p><span id="id2576375"/>Over the course of the project, analysis and processing may result
in interim results which may be incorporated into the locally stored
copy of the text so that the interim results can be used in later
processing.  This process of enrichment can be carried out either by
manual editing of the documents using conventional text editors, or by
application programs. 
</p></div><div class="div3" id="PMEXP"><h5>24.1.4.4  Data Export</h5><p><span id="id2576398"/>When a document is to be exchanged with another site using the TEI
interchange format, it must first be transduced from the local storage
format to TEI interchange form.  If local documents are already
TEI-conformant, this requires either no processing at all, or a
relatively simple normalization which can be handled readily by the
normalization facilities of most SGML parsers.  If the local storage
form is non-SGML conformant (and not XML), some transducer must be used to transform
it into the TEI interchange format.</p><p><span id="id2576410"/>The TEI-interchange-format document must then be packed for shipping
into the TEI packed interchange format, using a packing program.  This
program will gather the constituent parts (files) of a document into a
single file, and ensure that the file contains no characters whose safe
passage to the recipient of the data is endangered by the transmission
path.  If the ultimate recipient of the document is unknown, the set of
safe characters is very small.  The specific <em>transmission
character set</em> however is independent of TEI conformance:  any
convenient set may be used where both parties agree.  The packer will
ensure that the transmission character set is properly identified.</p></div><div class="div3" id="PMIMP"><h5>24.1.4.5  Data Import</h5><p><span id="id2576441"/>When a document is received from another site using the TEI packed
interchange format, it must first be unpacked into a TEI
interchange-format document in the local character set.  It may then be
necessary to <em>naturalize</em> it by translating it into the
local storage format; if the local format is TEI- or SGML-conformant,
no processing is needed (although some SGML processors may offer a
facility for suppressing omissible markup).</p></div><div class="div3" id="CFPM"><h5>24.1.4.6  TEI Conformance in the Processing Model</h5><p><span id="id2576468"/>The notions of TEI interchange format and TEI packed interchange
format are central to the exchange of documents using the TEI
guidelines, whether the local storage format is TEI-conformant or not.
The TEI interchange format and the TEI local-processing format may each
be used as a local storage format, though the local storage format
might well differ from either of these without materially affecting the
use of TEI formats for interchange.  The TEI interchange format being
less flexible than the local-processing format, it is expected that
sites using SGML-conformant software may use the latter, while sites
without such software may prefer the former.</p><p><span id="id2576483"/>The notion of TEI recommended practice, it is hoped, will be
relevant to decisions about what textual features should be recorded
during data capture and will thus affect data-capture formats and the
transducers which render captured files into the local storage format.</p><p><span id="id2576492"/>The TEI abstract structure may be useful in developing local
non-SGML markup schemes for data capture or for processing with ad hoc
application programs.  It is strongly recommended that the TEI
recommendations, as well as the TEI abstract structure, be used for
such development as well.</p></div></div><div class="div2" id="CFASP"><h4>24.1.5  Aspects of Conformance and Document Description</h4><div class="div3" id="CFCH"><h5>24.1.5.1  Character Sets</h5><div class="p"><span id="id2576525"/>Neither the character sets used for local processing nor those used
for transmission of interchange documents are restricted by the
definition of TEI conformance.  For local processing, users will
typically use the system character set of their local system or some
modification thereof.  For exchange with known partners, users should
choose any convenient character set; typically the most convenient is
the set of all characters which:
<ul><li>are transmitted successfully over the existing transmission link;</li><li>occur in both sender's and receiver's local coded character sets.</li></ul></div><p><span id="id2576548"/>For blind exchange with unknown partners a conservative choice of
transmission set is needed to ensure that characters arrive
correctly.  How conservative the choice need be depends on the medium
of transmission.  The <em>ISO 646 subset</em>
 remains the only guaranteed safe set of characters
for the regional and international networks most widely used, although
larger character sets are increasingly coming into use. This is
largely because silent and not always reversible translation between
character sets remains a feature of transmissions across current
disparate networks.  At the present time (1993) therefore, only the
ISO 646 subset is recommended for fully blind interchange, although
the full complement of ISO character sets may be used successfully in
some subdomains.</p><p><span id="id2576573"/>In transmission by disk or tape, however, no silent translation is
likely to occur, and so larger sets may be successfully used in blind
interchange.  The primary danger is a failure of software in the
receiving machine to process the characters correctly; at this time
(1991), ASCII or 94-character U.S. EBCDIC appear to represent the
largest safe choices; other national character sets may of course be
used if good internal documentation is also provided.</p><p><span id="id2576584"/>Note that the transmission character set does not associate specific
binary encodings with the characters in the set.  In the technical
senses, it is a character set, not a <em>coded</em> character set.
This means that a document may undergo various automatic translations
from one coded character set to another (notably, in the case of
transmission over international networks, from ASCII to EBCDIC or vice
versa) without leaving the <em>transmission character set</em>.</p><p><span id="id2576603"/>For further discussion of the topics addressed in this section, reference
should be made to chapter <a class="link_ptr" href="USE.html#IN" title="30">24.3  Rules for Interchange</a>.</p></div><div class="div3" id="CFSD"><h5>24.1.5.2  SGML Declaration</h5><p><span id="id2576625"/>The utility of various SGML constructs is discussed in section
 2.2 of document TEI P1 version 1.  The restrictions on SGML declarations
and SGML usage in TEI interchange documents discussed above under <a class="link_ptr" href="USE.html#SGMLMOD" title="Modifications to TEI SGML Declaration">24.1.2  Modifications to TEI SGML Declaration</a>
 are derived from that discussion. In the case of XML, no SGML declaration changes
can be made.</p><p><span id="id2576638"/>No restrictions are made on SGML usage in the local processing
format because such usage is best determined locally and has no impact
on interchange.</p></div><div class="div3" id="CFDTD"><h5>24.1.5.3  Document Type Declaration</h5><p><span id="id2576657"/>The document type declaration provided by the TEI, whether in its SGML or its XML
form, is intended to
cover as wide a variety of document types and processing needs as
proved feasible.  It is impossible, however, for any finite list of
text elements to cover every need of textual research and processing.
As a result, extension of the TEI DTD has no effect
on strict TEI conformance, as long as certain restrictions are
observed; these have the effect of ensuring that later users of a file
can easily see what changes have been made to the DTDs and what the new
tags are intended to mean.</p><p><span id="id2576671"/>The requirement that all new or modified tags be documented,
however, is formally verifiable only to a limited extent.  It is
possible for a program to verify that for every tag introduced in a DTD
modification, a corresponding record exists in a Tag Set Declaration.
It is impossible, however, to verify using formal means that the entry
in the tag set declaration makes sense.  Purely formal conformance
measures, therefore, must be supplemented with human inspection of the
documentation.</p><p><span id="id2576683"/>The concept of DTD extension is introduced to allow the concise
description of software which is designed to handle documents encoded
using the published DTDs but which is not prepared to deal with tags
not included there.<a class="notelink" href="#Note152"><sup>152</sup></a></p><p><span id="id2576708"/>All sections of the TEI DTD are subject to modification by the
user, except that a documentary header must be provided and
distinguished from the text itself, and that documentary header must
include tagged elements identifying the document encoded and those
responsible for the encoding.  This ensures that all TEI-conformant
documents will have at least this bare minimum of accompanying
documentation.</p></div><div class="div3" id="CFTAG"><h5>24.1.5.4  Tag Usage and Feature Marking</h5><p><span id="id2576730"/>The basic design principles of the TEI require the notion of
<em>TEI conformance</em> to be applicable to existing electronic
documents if they are translated into a proper format, without
requiring the insertion of information not captured in the initial
preparation of the text.<a class="notelink" href="#Note153"><sup>153</sup></a></p><p><span id="id2576751"/>At the same time, the TEI is charged with formulating advice to
those engaged in the creation of new electronic texts and is required
to distinguish what is actively recommended for general use from what
is merely optional, provided for use by those engaged in a particular
sort of work.</p><p><span id="id2576760"/>The notion of <em>TEI recommended practice</em> is introduced to
allow the concise description of documents in which not only the
requirements, but also the recommendations of the Guidelines are
followed.  It is hoped that while projects to convert existing
electronic data may content themselves with achieving TEI conformance,
projects to produce new electronic texts will produce documents
following TEI recommended practice.  To distinguish those projects
which follow the TEI's recommendation to use SGML or XML markup from those
which capture the same underlying textual features but do so using
other markup, the notion of the <em>TEI abstract model</em> is
introduced; it is this which another encoding can have in
common with the TEI.</p></div><div class="div3" id="CFNON"><h5>24.1.5.5  Non-SGML, non-XML Markup</h5><p><span id="id2576795"/>In exchanging texts for use by others, the goal of an interchange
format is to ensure that the information encoded in an electronic
version of a text can be correctly understood and processed by the
recipient as well as by the originator of the text.  To assure the
achievement of this goal, the definition offered here of TEI
conformance restricts markup in TEI conformant documents to SGML or XML markup
and to other properly declared notations.  The latter are explicitly
recommended for the encoding of tables,
figures, etc. and so cannot reasonably be excluded.  Since they do
place a burden on the recipient for proper processing, the use of any
such notation is defined to fall within the class of DTD extensions.</p><p><span id="id2576811"/>Because of the escape clause for graphics, etc., it is in principle
possible to create a TEI conformant document by embedding a document
using any arbitrary markup into a driver file containing a TEI header
and a declaration for the appropriate markup as notation.
Though it falls within the letter, such a practice falls outside the
spirit of TEI-conformant document interchange.</p></div></div></div><div class="div1" id="MD"><h3>24.2  Modifying and Customizing the TEI DTD</h3><p><span id="id2576842"/>These Guidelines provide an encoding scheme suitable for encoding a
wide range of texts, and capable of being extended in well-defined and
documented ways for texts that cannot be conveniently or appropriately
encoded using what is provided.  This chapter describes how the TEI
encoding scheme may be customized, and should be read in conjunction
with chapter <a class="link_ptr" href="TD.html" title="27">23  Documentation Elements</a>, which describes how the TEI encoding
scheme is documented.  The modification scheme described in that
chapter is, like the rest of the TEI scheme, independent of any
particular schema or document type definition language. </p><p class="italic"><span id="id2576860"/>The present chapter has not been fully revised. In
particular, it
discusses only the modification methods provided for users of XML DTD
fragments, rather than the more powerful mechanisms now available
using the ODD schema described in chapter <a class="link_ptr" href="TD.html" title="27">23  Documentation Elements</a>. </p><p><span id="id2576875"/>Formally speaking, these Guidelines provide both syntactic
information about how elements and attributes may be used in
valid documents and semantic information about what interpretation
should be attached to given syntactic constructs. In this sense, they
are both  a <em>document type definition</em> and a <em>document
type declaration</em>. In the present version of the Guidelines,
this semantic information is provided only as informal descriptive
prose. Although the descriptions have been
written with care, there will inevitably be cases where the intention of
the contributors has not been conveyed with sufficient clarity to
prevent users of the Guidelines from ‘extending’ them
in the sense of attaching slightly variant semantics to them.</p><p><span id="id2576902"/>Beyond this unintentional semantic extension, some of the elements
described can intentionally be used in a variety of ways; for example,
the element <code>&lt;note&gt;</code> has an attribute <span class="att">type</span> which
can take on arbitrary string values, depending on how it is used in a
document.  A new type of annotation, therefore, requires no extension to
the TEI document type definition.</p><div class="p"><span id="id2576919"/>Furthermore, there are several ways for combining and extending the
existing syntactic mechanisms themselves.  Earlier chapters have
identified these:
<ul><li>combining the supplied modules as described in chapter <a class="link_ptr" href="ST.html" title="3">2  The TEI infrastructure</a>; </li><li>documenting how non-standard characters are represented  in
a document by providing extensions to the Unicode character
definitions, as
described in chapter <a class="link_ptr" href="WD.html" title="25">21  Representation of non-standard characters and glyphs</a>;</li><li>extending the intentionally open-ended feature structure mechanism
by providing one or more feature system declarations, as described in
chapter <a class="link_ptr" href="FD.html" title="26">22  Feature System Declaration</a>.</li></ul>
This chapter explains how the supplied modules can be customized by
suppressing elements, renaming elements, extending syntactic classes,
and adding elements.  The different techniques described here have
different effects on the level of TEI conformance to be ascribed to a
text, as described in chapter <a class="link_ptr" href="USE.html#CF" title="28">24.1  Conformance</a>.</div><p><span id="id2576968"/>The TEI scheme is designed to support modification and customization
in a documented way that can be validated by an XML processor.  Those
wishing to modify the TEI modules must do so using <em>only</em> the
mechanisms described in this chapter if the resulting documents are to
be TEI-conformant.</p><p><span id="id2576981"/>The mechanisms used to instantiate the TEI modifications differ for
different schema languages. In XML DTDs, for example, extensive use is made of
parameter entities, so that the TEI DTD fragments
are supplied in a <em>parameterized</em> form, in which some content
models, element names, and entity values are  represented not
by fixed form literals but by parameter entity references. In other
parts of these Guidelines, the text of the DTD fragments has been
presented in a partially <em>resolved</em> form, in which the names of
elements are given as absolute literals
(e.g. name, rather than
%n.name;) for the sake of clarity of
discussion. Content models presented elsewhere, however, are given in
parameterized form throughout
(e.g. %macro.paraContent;). This is because, in some cases,  the actual value of
the parameter entity used will differ depending on which tagsets are
in use, and also because the modification mechanisms discussed here
depend on the ability to redefine these entities.  Software tools to
automatically derive a fully
resolved DTD from a parameterized version of it are widely available,
and form a component of any validating SGML or XML parser.<a class="notelink" href="#Note154"><sup>154</sup></a></p><div class="p"><span id="id2577032"/>In the absence of any modification, a collection of TEI modules
will behave as follows:
<ol><li>All the elements described in the relevant sections of these
  Guidelines are defined.</li><li>The names of these elements are as given by these Guidelines.</li><li>The content model of each element is as given by these Guidelines.</li><li>The attributes of each element and the names and types of these
  attributes are as given in these Guidelines.</li><li>The membership of element classes, and the resultant inheritance
  of attributes are as given in these Guidelines.</li></ol>
The modification mechanisms allow the user to override these defaults
in the following ways, while retaining conformance to the TEI
Guidelines:
<ol><li>The definition of elements may be suppressed, so deleting the
      associated elements from the modified schema.</li><li>The name (generic identifier) associated with an element may
      be changed, while preserving the semantics of the element.  Note,
      however, that the new name may not clash with the default name of
      any element defined in these Guidelines.</li><li>The global <span class="att">TEIform</span> attribute should be used to specify
the TEI name for such renamed elements.</li><li>Those parts of the content model of an element which are specified
      by classes may be extended by adding members to the classes.</li><li>Further attributes, together with their names and types, may be
      specified for an individual element and existing attributes for an
      individual element may be
      renamed.  Note that the new names may not clash with names of
      existing attributes for the element.</li><li>Further attributes, together with their names and types, may be
      specified for the elements in a particular class and those
      inheriting characteristics from that class.</li></ol>
The modification mechanisms presented in this chapter are quite general,
and may be used to make all the types of changes just listed.  They can
also be used to make more complete modifications of the DTD; if changes
other than those listed above are made, however, the resulting text will
no longer be TEI conformant.
	</div><p><span id="id2577123"/>These Guidelines provide for user modification of the TEI DTD largely
by using parameter entities at appropriate points in the DTD.  It
is not absolutely essential to understand them in detail to modify the
TEI DTD (the examples later in this chapter can be followed cookbook
fashion), but it will probably prove helpful. An example set of
modification files is provided as part of the current release: see
further section <a class="link_ptr" href="USE.html#MDlite" title="TEI Lite: an example Customization">24.2.3  TEI Lite: an example Customization</a> below.</p><p><span id="id2577146"/>Parameter entities are a mechanism for allowing string substitution
within markup declarations; they can thus can be used to effect
changes in declarations.  A parameter entity, unlike an element, may
be declared more than once in a DTD; if more than one declaration is
given, the parser uses the first one it encounters.  Since the
declaration subset within the document is read before the external
file containing the predefined DTD, an entity declaration in the DTD
subset will take precedence over one in the external file.  In the TEI
DTD, the literal string which defines the model group for some
elements, say <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, is made the value of a parameter entity; the
actual element declaration for <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> contains not the literal
string itself, but a reference to the parameter entity (in this case,
<span class="ident-pe">macro.paraContent</span>).  If the document's DTD
subset contains a declaration for <span class="ident-pe">macro.paraContent</span>, this will be used in preference
to the standard definition within the external TEI DTD files.  The
redefinability of parameter entities accounts both for the TEI's use
of parameter entities as the vehicle for effecting extensions, and for
the separation of entity definitions from other material (to be
defined below) that might be needed for certain modifications of the
TEI DTD.</p><div class="p"><span id="id2577189"/>Local modifications are most conveniently grouped into two files,
one containing modifications to the TEI parameter entities, and the
other containing new or changed declarations of elements and their
attributes.  Names for these files should be specified by the
parameter entities <span class="ident-pe">extensions-decl</span> and
<span class="ident-pe">extensions</span>, by declarations such as the
following:
<div class="pre_eg">&lt;!ENTITY % extensions-decl SYSTEM 'project.ent' &gt;
&lt;!ENTITY % extensions SYSTEM 'project.dtd' &gt;</div>
These declarations must be given in the document's DTD subset.  The
first will be needed for all of the modifications discussed below.
The second is only required for the last type of extension
described. The parameter entities thus defined are then referenced at
an appropriate point in the compiling of the TEI DTD, as further
described in section <a class="link_ptr" href="ST.html#STIN" title="Defining a TEI schema">2.2  Defining a TEI schema</a>.</div><div class="div2" id="MDMD"><h4>24.2.1  Kinds of Modification</h4><div class="p"><span id="id2577237"/>There are several kinds of modification that can be made to the TEI
DTD as follows:
<ol><li>deletion of elements;</li><li>renaming of elements;</li><li>extension of classes;</li><li>modification of content models or attribute lists.</li></ol>
These are described in the remaining sections of this chapter.</div><p><span id="id2577264"/>Each kind of modification changes the set of documents that can be
parsed using the DTD. Each combination of the original TEI DTD
fragments may be thought of as defining a certain set of
documents. Each DTD resulting from a modified set of TEI DTD
fragments allows a different set of documents to be parsed.  The set
of documents parsed by the original DTD may be properly contained in
the set of documents parsed by a modified DTD, or vice versa.
Modifications that have either of these two results are called
<em>clean modifications</em> in the remainder of the chapter.
Alternatively, the set of documents parsed by the original DTD might
overlap the set of documents parsed by the modified DTD with neither
being properly contained in the other.  Modifications that have this
result are called <em>unclean modifications</em> in the remainder
of the chapter.</p><div class="div3" id="MDMDSU"><h5>24.2.1.1  Suppressing Elements</h5><div class="p"><span id="id2577300"/>The simplest way to modify the supplied tag sets is to suppress one
or more of the supplied elements.  In the modifiable version of the
DTDs, every element declaration is enclosed by a marked section.  The
marked section is governed by one of the keywords <span class="val">IGNORE</span> or <span class="val">INCLUDE</span>, which is
provided indirectly using a parameter entity. This parameter entity
has the same name as the generic identifier of the element.  Thus, the
declaration for the paragraph element, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, occurs within a
marked section ‘guarded’ by the parameter entity
<span class="ident-pe">p</span>:
<div class="pre_eg"> %p; [
&lt;!-- element and attlist declaration for p goes here   --&gt;
]]
</div>
The declaration given for these <em>guard entities</em> in the
modifiable version is <span class="val">INCLUDE</span> in all cases.  The
construct above is interpreted thus: the first of the three lines is
the opening of a marked section; when the parser encounters the
section and sees the keyword <span class="val">INCLUDE</span> as its guard (more
precisely, sees a parameter entity the value of which is the keyword
<span class="val">INCLUDE</span>), the content of the marked section is parsed;
the second line of the three is the content of the marked section; and
the third line of the three is the closing of a marked section.  If
the guard is changed to <span class="val">IGNORE</span>, the parser will
ignore the content of the marked section.</div><div class="p"><span id="id2577365"/>Thus, to delete the declaration of a generic identifier and thus
suppress the element entirely, the entity that provides the guard on the
marked section wherein the element declaration appears must simply be
set to <span class="val">IGNORE</span>.  For example, if the <code>&lt;note&gt;</code>
element is not to be used in a particular application, the line
<div class="pre_eg">&lt;!ENTITY % note 'IGNORE'&gt;</div>
should appear somewhere in the DTD prior to its reference in the guard
around the declaration for the <code>&lt;note&gt;</code> element. This is achieved
by  inserting the above declaration in the file which has its name given by the entity
<span class="ident-pe">extensions-decl</span>.</div><p><span id="id2577399"/>Two different cases of deleting one or more elements from the TEI
DTD can be identified.  The first case involves deleting only elements
that are optional wherever they appear in TEI documents.  Deleting these
is clean in the sense that documents that are parseable with the modified
DTD can also be parsed according to the original TEI DTD.  To say this
another way, the set of documents matching the new DTD is contained in
the set of documents matching the original DTD.</p><p><span id="id2577411"/>The second case involves deleting elements that are required in one
or more of their appearances in TEI documents.  Deleting these is
unclean in that some documents that can be parsed according to the new
DTD could not be parsed according to the original TEI DTD.  To say this
another way, the set of documents matching the new DTD neither contains
nor is contained in the set of documents matching the original DTD.</p></div><div class="div3" id="MDMDNM"><h5>24.2.1.2  Renaming Elements</h5><div class="p"><span id="id2577434"/>In the modifiable version of the TEI DTD, elements are not referred to
directly by their generic identifiers; instead, the modifiable version
of the DTD makes use of parameter entities that expand to the standard
generic identifiers.  This allows renaming of elements by redefining the
appropriate parameter entities.  The names of parameter entities used
for naming are formed by taking the standard generic identifier of the
element and attaching the string ‘n.’ (for ‘name’) as a
prefix.  Thus, the standard generic identifiers for paragraphs, notes
and quotations, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;note&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;q&gt;</code>, are defined
by declarations of the following form:
<div class="pre_eg">&lt;!ENTITY % n.p        'p'&gt;
&lt;!ENTITY % n.note     'note'&gt;
&lt;!ENTITY % n.soCalled 'soCalled'&gt;</div>
These parameter entities are all contained within a file (<span class="ident-file">teigis.ent</span>) which is embedded during the compilation
of a TEI DTD.  To change the name of an element therefore, all that
is needed is to provide an overriding declaration for the appropriate
parameter entity. For instance, the following declaration converts <code>&lt;note&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;annotation&gt;</code>:
<div class="pre_eg">&lt;!ENTITY % n.note 'annotation'&gt;</div>
This declaration must be inserted in the file which has its name given
by the entity <span class="ident-pe">extensions-decl</span>.</div><p><span id="id2577500"/>Two different cases of renaming can be identified.  The first case
involves replacing existing names with names that are otherwise unused
in the TEI scheme.  (This can be easily checked by looking in the
index of the Guidelines.)  Such a modification is clean in that the new
DTD would still accepts any document accepted by the publication DTD
(given the appropriate renaming of elements).  The new name cannot
possibly conflict with the generic identifier of any other element,
since there can be no other occurrences.  To say this another way, the
set of documents matching the new DTD is isomorphic to the set of
documents matching the old DTD.  The example given results in a clean
modification because there is no element <code>&lt;annotation&gt;</code>
specified in these Guidelines.  It is also true that any document not
using the renamed element which parses under the unmodified DTD will
also parse under the modified DTD.</p><p><span id="id2577523"/>The second case involves introducing a name already used somewhere
in a TEI tag set.  This is unclean in that it changes what an existing
generic identifier means.  The name in question could not be declared
by any tag set that is used in the document, as it is syntactically
invalid to provide two declarations for the same element.  The new
generic identifier might occur in some TEI tag set not currently
included in the DTD used to parse the document.  For example, if in
some setting the element <code>&lt;note&gt;</code> were assigned the new
name <code>&lt;fs&gt;</code> (because, say, notes are used in some
technical document to record functional specifications) there might be
no immediate problem.  If however it was later decided to add the
feature structure analysis tag set into the DTD used to parse the
document, though, a name clash would occur. There would also be
problems in interchanging the resulting documents without confusion.</p><p><span id="id2577549"/>As a special case, consider translating all of the generic
identifiers for all elements into some other language, L.  It may be,
for example, that the word for ‘paragraph’ in language L begins
with the letter ‘s’ and that thus the paragraph element is
renamed as <code>&lt;s&gt;</code>.  By the definition just given, this
would be an unclean modification because an element <code>&lt;s&gt;</code>
already exists in the TEI DTD.  However, this is clearly not a
problem so long as all of the names are redefined at once and that no
collisions occur in the new name space: that is, provided that the TEI
element <code>&lt;s&gt;</code> is renamed as some other string.  This can be done
by a total replacement of the file that contains the entity
declarations for the names of the elements.  This systematic
replacement of names in the DTD must be followed by a systematic use
(or replacement) of the new names in the document.  To think about
this in the terms used earlier, the set of documents matching the new
DTD (with all names systematically changed in both the DTD and the
documents) is isomorphic to the set of documents matching the original
DTD with no names changed (in either the DTD or the documents).</p></div><div class="div3" id="MDMDCL"><h5>24.2.1.3  Class Extension</h5><p><span id="id2577602"/>In <a class="link_ptr" href="ST.html#STECCM" title="Model Classes">2.6.2  Model Classes</a>, the concept of a class of elements that
can appear in the same kinds of structural locations in a document was
introduced.  In the RelaxNG schema fragments, a pattern is  associated
with each named model class; in the XML DTD fragments, a parameter
entity is used. For example, the value of the pattern (or parameter entity)
<span class="ident-pe">model.biblLike</span> in a TEI schema will be  a list of the members of the class
<span class="ident-class">model.biblLike</span>.</p><p><span id="id2577658"/>In the modifiable version of the TEI DTD, an additional entity is
defined for each model class.  This additional entity also takes the
name of the class, this time prefixed by the string ‘x.’ (for
‘extension’).  The default value of these <em>x-dot
entities</em> is always the empty string.  A reference to the
corresponding x-dot entity is always included within the replacement
string for each m-dot entity.  This enables an encoder to add new
members to a class simply by declaring a new value for its associated
x-dot entity.</p><div class="p"><span id="id2577682"/>For example, the class <span class="ident-class">model.biblLike</span> has the three
members <code>&lt;bibl&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;biblFull&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;biblStruct&gt;</code>.
Its content-model entity is defined thus:
<div class="pre_eg">&lt;!ENTITY % x.bibl '' &gt;
&lt;!ENTITY % model.biblLike '%x.bibl; bibl | biblFull | biblStruct' &gt;</div>
With the default value of the x-dot entity, this is the same as
defining <span class="ident-class">tei.model.biblLike</span> with the replacement text
<tt>bibl | biblFull | biblStruct</tt>.</div><div class="p"><span id="id2577721"/>An encoder can add an element to the class by providing a new
declaration for the x-dot entity.  For example, to add a new element
called <code>&lt;my.bib&gt;</code>, this definition would be used:
<div class="pre_eg">&lt;!ENTITY % x.bibl 'my.bib |' &gt;</div>
Note that the specification of an x-dot entity must always end with
the vertical bar character (for alternation).  The definition would be
inserted at the appropriate place in the file associated with the
entity <span class="ident-pe">extensions-decl</span>.  This changes the
replacement text of <span class="ident-pe">model.biblLike</span> from its default
value to <tt>my.bib | bibl | biblFull |
biblStruct</tt>.  If more than one element is to be added to a
class, the x-dot entity for the class should be redefined as a list of
the new generic identifiers, each one (<em>including the
last</em>) followed by a vertical bar.</div><p><span id="id2577763"/>Class extension is always clean in that the set of documents matching
the DTD containing the extended class contains all of the documents
matching the original DTD.  Class extension can imply either the
addition of an existing
element to a pre-defined class, or the addition of a new element (as described in the next
section) to one.</p></div><div class="div3" id="MDMDRM"><h5>24.2.1.4  New content models</h5><p><span id="id2577785"/>Encoders can modify the content models that specify what is
contained in an element or set of elements defined by the TEI DTD,
modify the attributes of existing elements, or add new elements to the
DTD.</p><p><span id="id2577792"/>Content models or attributes for existing elements are
modified in two stages.  First, the existing declaration of the element
must be deleted in the manner described in the first section of this
chapter.  Second, a new declaration for the element is given.  This new
declaration must be inserted in the file associated with the entity
<span class="ident-pe">extensions</span>.</p><div class="p"><span id="id2577808"/>For example, suppose that symbolic designations to be marked with
the element <code>&lt;term&gt;</code> can always be associated with a particular
source.  While the content model of the publication version of the TEI
DTD is acceptable, the attribute list needs to be extended.  To
perform this modification, the following steps must be taken.  The
declaration
<div class="pre_eg">&lt;!ENTITY % term 'IGNORE' &gt;</div>
must be inserted into the file associated with the entity <span class="ident-pe">extensions-decl</span>.  Then a new definition must be
inserted into the file associated with the entity <span class="ident-pe">extensions</span>.  In this example, the definition
will be the same as that given in <a class="link_ptr" href="CO.html#COHQU" title="Terms, Glosses, Equivalents and Descriptions">4.3.4  Terms, Glosses, Equivalents and Descriptions</a>, save for the
addition of a new attribute.

file associated with the entity <span class="ident-pe">extensions</span>.  To be usable, they must somehow
be included in the model for some existing element.  This can be done
either by class extension (which can now be seen to be a restricted,
special case of the process defined here) or by redefining the
element(s) within which the new element is to be included.</p><p><span id="id2577868"/>The set of documents matched by the modified DTD and the set of
documents matched by the original DTD may be related in several
different ways.  It is certainly possible that the former could
properly include the latter or vice versa; either of these could be
said to be clean modifications because the set to be matched has
become strictly larger or strictly smaller.</p><p><span id="id2577878"/>It is also possible that the set of documents matched by the
modified DTD is different from the set matched by the original DTD and
they may either contain some common documents or have no documents in
common; either of these is said to be an unclean modification.</p><p><span id="id2577887"/>Radical revision is
possible.  It would be possible to remodel so that the
<code>&lt;teiHeader&gt;</code> is not required, or so that it is required but the
minimal components described in chapter <a class="link_ptr" href="HD.html" title="5">3  The TEI Header</a> are no
longer required, or so that no <code>&lt;text&gt;</code> element is required.  In
fact, the mechanism, if used in an extreme way, permits deletion of
the entire set of TEI definitions and their replacement by an entirely
different DTD!  Such revisions would result in documents that are not
TEI conformant in even the broadest sense, and it is not intended that
encoders use the mechanism in this way.</p></div></div><div class="div2" id="MDDO"><h4>24.2.2  Documenting the
Modifications</h4><p><span id="id2577929"/>When the modification mechanisms are used,
their use must be documented.  There are two ways in which information
about the modifications is recorded.</p><div class="p"><span id="id2577936"/>The first record of the
modifications is in the use of the extension files.  The file
associated with the entity <span class="ident-pe">extensions-decl</span>
contains the specifications of the parameter entities that are
redefined to accomplish the modifications.  This file should be
structured in such a way that readers can easily identify any
modifications that have been made.  The following structure is
recommended.
<div class="pre_eg"/>
The appropriate parameter entity specifications should be entered
after each comment in this file.  The order of the comments
corresponds to the order of the discussion in this chapter (roughly,
from simple to complex).  Setting the appropriate entity to <span class="val">IGNORE</span> for each revised element is done in the last
section of the file.</div><div class="p"><span id="id2577964"/>The file associated with the entity <span class="ident-pe">extensions</span> should contain the DTD fragments
for new and changed element definitions.  The following structure is
recommended.
<div class="pre_eg"/></div><p><span id="id2577978"/>These files give a parser sufficient information to implement
the modifications and are also useful in providing human readers with
some indication of the changes made in the TEI DTD.  Full
documentation of any additional or modified elements should also be
provided, using the ancillary tag set described in chapter <a class="link_ptr" href="TD.html" title="27">23  Documentation Elements</a>.</p></div><div class="div2" id="MDlite"><h4>24.2.3  TEI Lite: an example Customization</h4><p><span id="id2578004"/>Shortly after publication of the first edition of these Guidelines,
as a demonstration of how the TEI encoding scheme might be adopted to
meet 90% of the needs of 90% of the TEI user community, the TEI
editors produced a brief tutorial defining one specific
‘clean’ modification of the TEI scheme, which they
called TEI Lite. This tutorial and its associated DTD became very
popular and are available from the TEI web site at
<a class="link_ptr" href="http://www.tei-c.org/Lite/" title=""><span>http://www.tei-c.org/Lite/</span></a>. The modification files used to
define this view of the TEI are also included among the TEI DTD
fragments and may be used as a model for other customizations.</p><div class="p"><span id="id2578026"/>The introductory tutorial on TEI Lite describes in more detail how
the tagset was defined, and the rationale underlying its selection of
available TEI features. For the present purposes, we note that it
required elements taken from the TEI prose base, and also from the TEI
additional tag sets for linking, for analysis, and for figures and
tables. A small number of additional phrase-level elements not defined
in the main TEI scheme were also needed. Finally, large number of the
elements made available by this combination of tagsets were not
needed, and could be cleanly discarded from the DTD. To effect this,
the following doctype declaration (available in the file <span class="ident-file">teilite.dec</span>) was appropriate:
<div class="pre_eg">&lt;!DOCTYPE TEI PUBLIC "-//TEI P5//DTD Main DTD Driver File//EN" 'tei2.dtd' [
&lt;!ENTITY % TEI.prose    'INCLUDE' &gt;
&lt;!ENTITY % TEI.linking  'INCLUDE' &gt;
&lt;!ENTITY % TEI.analysis 'INCLUDE' &gt;
&lt;!ENTITY % TEI.figures  'INCLUDE' &gt;
&lt;!ENTITY % TEI.XML      'INCLUDE' &gt;
&lt;!ENTITY % extensions-decl SYSTEM 'teilitex.ent' &gt;
&lt;!ENTITY % extensions SYSTEM 'teilitex.dtd' &gt;
]&gt;</div>
This declaration is  appropriate for an XML customization. If an
SGML version is required, the parameter entity <span class="ident-pe">TEI.XML</span>
should be redefined, by replacing its declaration above with a
declaration like the following:
<div class="pre_eg">&lt;!ENTITY % TEI.XML  "IGNORE"&gt;</div></div><div class="p"><span id="id2578071"/>The file <span class="ident-file">teilitex.ent</span> consists largely of
declarations like the following:
<div class="pre_eg">&lt;!ENTITY % TEI      'INCLUDE' &gt;
&lt;!ENTITY % teiCorpus  'IGNORE' &gt;</div> 
There is one line for each element potentially available in the
tagsets selected, indicating whether it is to be included in the
resulting DTD or not. By default, elements are always included, so the
first line above is not strictly necessary. However, its inclusion
makes it easier for the user of this extension file to see at a glance
which elements from the original DTD have been included and which have
not. </div><div class="p"><span id="id2578098"/>This file also contains, at its start, 
declarations for four  parameter entities used in defining content
models. The first three are needed to add the new (non-TEI) elements
declared for this customization into existing model classes:
<div class="pre_eg">&lt;!ENTITY % x.data      'ident | code | kw |'                    &gt;
&lt;!ENTITY % x.inter     'eg |'                                   &gt;
&lt;!ENTITY % x.common    'eg |'                                   &gt;</div>
As further discussed in section <a class="link_ptr" href="ST.html#STEC" title="The TEI Class System">2.6  The TEI Class System</a>, these
declarations have the effect of adding the elements <code>&lt;ident&gt;</code>,
<code>&lt;code&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;kw&gt;</code> to the <span class="ident-class">model.pPart.data</span>
model class, and adding the element <code>&lt;eg&gt;</code> to the <span class="ident-class">model.inter</span> and <span class="ident-class">model.common</span>
classes. Without these declarations, the elements named here would not
appear anywhere within the structure of the TEI DTD.</div><div class="p"><span id="id2578154"/>The entity file also redefines the <span class="ident-class">att.global.linking</span> attribute class, which is used to add
linking attributes to all elements when the <span class="ident-pe">TEI.linking</span>
tag set is enabled. In TEI lite only a subset of the linking
attributes, given by the following definition, is required (compare
this declaration with that in the reference section for this class):
<div class="pre_eg">&lt;!ENTITY % a.linking '
          corresp            IDREFS              #IMPLIED
          next               IDREF               #IMPLIED
          prev               IDREF               #IMPLIED'      &gt;</div></div><p><span id="id2578177"/>In addition, this entity file contains declarations for a number of
commonly used character entity sets (see further chapter <a class="link_ptr" href="CH.html" title="4">1  Languages and Character Sets</a>) and graphic notations (see further section <a class="link_ptr" href="FT.html#FTGRA" title="Specific Elements for Graphic Images">19.3  Specific Elements for Graphic Images</a>). Different sets will be declared, depending on
whether the parameter entity <span class="ident-pe">TEI.XML</span> is
specified as <span class="val">INCLUDE</span> or <span class="val">IGNORE</span>. The XML
version of TEI Lite supplies Unicode definitions for these character
entities; the SGML version supplies SDATA declarations. </p><div class="p"><span id="id2578215"/>As supplied, the following is typical of the character entity
set declarations included for XML:
<div class="pre_eg">&lt;!ENTITY % ISOlat1 
    PUBLIC "-//TEI//ENTITIES Unicode values for ISO 8879 Added Latin 1//EN"
   "iso-lat1.ent"&gt;</div></div><div class="p"><span id="id2578227"/>This declaration associates the parameter entity <span class="ident-pe">ISOlat1</span> with a public entity defined by the TEI with
the formal identifier <span class="ident-fpi">-//TEI//ENTITIES Unicode values for ISO
8879 Added Latin 1//EN</span>. The user may specify the actual
location of this entity in a number of ways: the default is to seek a
file with the name <span class="ident-file">iso-lat1.ent</span>. This may be
over-ridden by supplying an alternative location for the entity set,
either by means of another declaration in the DTD subset, or by means
of an alternative entry in an associated SGML Open Catalog
file. Sample copies of the standard entity sets are available from the
TEI web site at <a class="link_ptr" href="http://www.tei-c.org/XML_Entities/" title=""><span>http://www.tei-c.org/XML_Entities/</span></a>, so one way of modifying the
above declaration for an XML DTD might be
<div class="pre_eg">&lt;!ENTITY % ISOlat1 
    PUBLIC "-//TEI//ENTITIES Unicode values for ISO 8879 Added Latin 1//EN"
   "http://www.tei-c.org/XML_Entities/iso-lat1.ent"&gt;</div></div><div class="p"><span id="id2578270"/>SGML versions for the same entity sets are also available. These have a different
formal public identifier, but the same default system identifier: thus, if the
parameter entity <span class="ident-pe">TEI.XML</span> has the value
<span class="val">IGNORE</span>, the declaration for <span class="ident-pe">ISOlat1</span> will be as follows: 
<div class="pre_eg">&lt;!ENTITY % ISOlat1 
    PUBLIC "ISO 8879-1986//ENTITIES Added Latin 1//EN"
   "iso-lat1.ent"&gt;</div></div><div class="p"><span id="id2578297"/>Again, the user can override this association by specifying a
different system identifier in the DTD subset, or in a local catalog
file; sample entity sets for SGML are also available from the TEI web
	  site at <a class="link_ptr" href="http://www.tei-c.org/ISO_Entities" title=""><span>http://www.tei-c.org/ISO_Entities</span></a>, so
one way of modifying the above declaration for an SGML DTD might be
<div class="pre_eg">&lt;!ENTITY % ISOlat1 
    PUBLIC "ISO 8879-1986//ENTITIES Added Latin 1//EN"
   "http://www.tei-c.org/ISO_Entities/iso-lat1.ent"&gt;</div></div><div class="p"><span id="id2578318"/>Following
their declaration, the parameter identifiers for these four entity sets are referenced:
<div class="pre_eg">%ISOlat1;
%ISOlat2;
%ISOpub; %ISOnum;</div></div><div class="p"><span id="id2578327"/>The remainder of the TEI Lite  extension entity file contains
declarations  for the following commonly used notations:
<div class="pre_eg">&lt;!NOTATION png PUBLIC
  '-//TEI//NOTATION IETF RFC2083 Portable Network Graphics//EN' &gt;
&lt;!NOTATION jpeg PUBLIC
  'ISO DIS 10918//NOTATION JPEG Graphics Format//EN' &gt;
&lt;!NOTATION tiff PUBLIC

&lt;!NOTATION wsd  PUBLIC
  '-//TEI P3-1994//NOTATION Writing System Declaration//EN' &gt;</div>
With these declarations in force, the TEI Lite user may embed graphics
in PNG, JPEG, TIFF, or GIF format (as further discussed in section
<a class="link_ptr" href="FT.html#FTGRA" title="Specific Elements for Graphic Images">19.3  Specific Elements for Graphic Images</a>; the declarations for SGML and for WSD are

the following declarations for the new elements listed above:
<div class="pre_eg">&lt;!ELEMENT %n.gi;     %om.RO; (#PCDATA)                             &gt;

other parts of the TEI DTD, in particular the parameter entities
<span class="ident-pe">om.RR</span> and <span class="ident-pe">om.RO</span>
which make the same extension file usable in both XML or SGML
contexts, as further explained in section <a class="link_ptr" href="ST.html#STXML" title="Generation of SGML or XML DTD fragments">2.8.5  Generation of SGML or XML DTD fragments </a>, and

definition for the global attributes.</p><p><span id="id2578424"/>Two of the elements listed above as ‘new’ are in
fact already defined in the auxiliary tag set for tagset documentation
discussed in chapter <a class="link_ptr" href="TD.html" title="27">23  Documentation Elements</a>; since, however, the extension
mechanism defined here does not allow us to include auxiliary tagsets
as such, we have simply copied the definitions for those elements
(<code>&lt;gi&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;eg&gt;</code>) from the DTD into our extension file,
thus allowing for them to be renamable. The other new elements are
simply defined in the same way as any others</p><div class="p"><span id="id2578450"/>To complete the job, full tag descriptions for the  new elements added
should be provided. Here is a sample description for the
<code>&lt;ident&gt;</code> element:
<div class="pre">&lt;tagDoc&gt;&lt;gi&gt;ident&lt;/gi&gt;
&lt;rs&gt;identifier&lt;/rs&gt;
&lt;desc&gt;contains an identifier in some formal language
(e.g. a variable name); also used for &lt;soCalled&gt;syntactic

&lt;attList&gt;
&lt;attDef&gt;&lt;attName&gt;type&lt;/attName&gt;&lt;desc&gt;

exclusively to the use of SGML-encoded TEI documents in
interchange. XML-encoded TEI documents may be safely interchanged
without formality over current networks, largely without concern for
any of the issues discussed here. This chapter has not therefore been
revised, and will probably be
withdrawn or substantially modified at the next release.</i></p></blockquote><p><span id="id2578510"/>This chapter describes how interested parties can determine and agree
on the proper format for the successful interchange of TEI-conformant
documents over a given communications link, and how to translate from
normal TEI form to the transmission format and back.  It also includes
recommendations for formats to be used when private arrangements cannot
be made, in non-negotiated or ‘blind’ interchange.
 </p><div class="div2" id="NHNEG"><h4>24.3.1  Negotiated Interchange</h4><p><span id="id2578536"/>When the sender and receiver of a given text know each other's
identity and can make appropriate special arrangements for the
interchange of the text, the following procedures may be used to
ensure the successful interchange of the text without information loss.
 </p><div class="p"><span id="id2578545"/>The sender and receiver together must first:
<ol><li>agree on whether to exchange the document in
<em>TEI interchange form</em> or in some other form (e.g.
<em>TEI local-processing form</em>)
 </li><li>identify the <em>communications link</em>:  the method to be
used to transmit and receive the document (transmission over a given
network, physical transmission of a disk, tape, or other medium, etc.)
 </li><li>identify (by experimentation if necessary) the set of characters
which can be transmitted successfully, without corruption, over the
communications link; this is the
<em>transmission character set</em>.
 </li><li>identify the set of characters present in the document which lie
outside the transmission character set; this is the set of
<em>non-transmissible characters</em>.  For each character in this
set, the local writing system declaration should identify an entity name
or a transliteration into the transmission character set, which is to be
used to transmit the character.  The set of entities needed for this
purpose is the <em>transmission entity set</em>.</li></ol></div><p><span id="id2578604"/>The transmission character set is defined as the set of characters
in the sender's system character set(s) which survive transmission and
are properly recognized in the recipient's system character set.  It is
therefore by definition a subset of both the sender's and the
recipient's system character sets.  The bit patterns used to represent
the characters may differ in the two systems (e.g. one may use ASCII,
the other EBCDIC) if the communications link performs the proper
translations.
 </p><p><span id="id2578617"/>Current network standards allow — indeed, require — gateway nodes
to translate material passing through the gateway from one coded
character set into another, when the networks joined by the gateway use
different coded character sets.  Since there is no universally
satisfactory translation among all coded character sets in common use,
the transmission character set will normally be the subset which is
satisfactorily translated by the gateways encountered in transit between
the sender and the receiver of the data.
 </p><p><span id="id2578639"/>When material is transmitted on a physical storage medium
(e.g. disk or tape), then those exchanging documents have far greater
control over the data.  If both partners use compatible systems, the
transmission character set may be equivalent to their system character
sets; otherwise, the transmission character set will include those
characters which the recipient can successfully read into the local
system character set from the media provided by the sender.  For
example, if a diskette created by an MS-DOS machine can be mailed to a
Macintosh user and read directly by the recipient's system, then the
transmission character set is likely to be ISO 646 IRV (equivalent to
ANSI X3.4, or ASCII), which both machines have in common; if the
recipient's disk-reading utilities are more sophisticated, however,
then it may be possible to include some or all of the two machines'
non-standard extended characters as well.
 </p><p><span id="id2578659"/>The mapping from non-transmissible characters to the transmission
entity set may be derived from the writing system declarations in use by
the sender and receiver.
 </p><div class="p"><span id="id2578666"/>After the transmission character set and entity character sets
have been defined, the sender must prepare and transmit the document:
<ol><li>if the document is to be exchanged in TEI interchange format,
translate it from the local-processing form into the TEI interchange
form (e.g. by passing SGML through an SGML normalizer to supply omitted
SGML tags and interpret all short-reference sequences; XML documents are
required to obey these same constraints, and
are considered to be in the interchange format)
 </li><li>in the case of SGML, pack the document for transmission by replacing every
non-transmissible character with the appropriate transliteration or
entity reference.  At this point, every character in the document is
represented either by a character in the transmission character set or
by a reference to an entity in the transmission entity set; the document
is in <em>TEI packed format</em>.  If the transmission character set
includes all the required delimiter characters, the document will be a
conforming SGML document; otherwise, it may not be SGML-conformant but
will be easily mappable to a conforming document. In the case of XML,
which is always in Unicode, the document may be packed to UTF-8 for 
transmission.
 </li><li>transmit the document over the agreed link
 </li></ol></div><p><span id="id2578709"/>The translation of non-transmissible characters into the transmission
entity set may be accomplished under automatic control, by software
which reads the appropriate local writing system declarations, creates
the necessary mapping tables, and packs the document for transmission.
 </p><div class="p"><span id="id2578718"/>Upon receipt, the receiver must:
<ol><li>unpack the document by expanding those entities which correspond
to characters in the local system character set(s); at this point, the
document should once more be conformant, and should probably be
validated to detect any problems in transmission</li><li>optionally, material transliterated in the document as transmitted
may be translated into the local system character set(s) for more
convenient display, or from the transmission entity set into a local
transliteration scheme; in XML this should not typically be necessary</li></ol></div><p><span id="id2578742"/>It is strongly recommended that when documents are interchanged they
be accompanied by any writing system declarations and feature system
declarations which are applicable.  In TEI-conformant interchange,
it is required that documents be accompanied by any applicable tag-set
documentation files.
 </p></div><div class="div2" id="NHEG"><h4>24.3.2  Some Simple Examples</h4><div class="p"><span id="id2578764"/>As a first simple example, consider an SGML document containing English,
French, and German, to be transmitted from an IBM-compatible personal
computer to a Macintosh, over a long-distance network connection.
Uploading test files from the PC to the sender's local network node,
sending the file via the network, and downloading the document to the
Macintosh, reveal (let us assume) that while all the characters of ISO
646 IRV survive intact, the accented characters of French and German do not
survive transmission.  In this case, the transmission character set is
composed of all the characters of 7-bit ISO 646.  The entity set
required to handle the non-transmissible characters will include the
following (assuming they actually occur in the document):
<ul><li>agrave</li><li>ccedille</li><li>eacute</li><li>egrave</li><li>ocirc</li><li>oelig</li><li>auml, Auml</li><li>ouml, Ouml</li><li>uuml, Uuml</li><li>szlig</li></ul>
When ‘packing’ the file for transmission, the sender
must replace the non-transmissible characters in the document with
references to these entities.  After this subsitution, the document is a
conforming document written entirely in the transmission character
set, which can be sent over the communications link without any garbling
or loss of information.  Upon receipt, the recipient can replace the
entity references with the specific coded characters used on the
Macintosh to write French and German.
 </div><p><span id="id2578832"/>As a second example, consider the same document being transmitted
from a VAX running VMS to an IBM mainframe running VM/CMS.  Here, the
accented characters might be represented on the VAX using the coded
character set ISO 8859-1, but since ISO 8859-1 is not always
supported, it may be more likely that entity references will be used
instead.  Let us assume that the network path between the two machines
accepts Latin characters and digits, and most punctuation, but garbles
square brackets, braces, the hash mark, and the pounds-sterling
symbol.  In this case, the accented characters require no special work
by the sender, since they are already in a network-safe form.  Square
brackets, etc., must however be replaced by entity references to
<span class="ident-ge">lbr</span>, <span class="ident-ge">rbr</span>, etc.  After
this is done, the document is no longer conformant SGML, since the
square brackets used in certain markup declarations will not be
recognized.  (It is important, therefore, for validation to be
performed before the square brackets are replaced by entity
references.)
 </p><p><span id="id2578877"/>Upon receipt, the document may be translated into a valid SGML
document by replacing all references to <span class="ident-ge">lbr</span>
and <span class="ident-ge">rbr</span> with the appropriate square brackets,
etc.  If the local system supports one of the IBM code pages with
support for French and German characters, then the entity references
to those characters may be replaced by the characters in the system
character set.  More commonly, the entities for French and German
characters will be left in place.
 </p><p><span id="id2578900"/>As a third example, consider a document containing Greek, as well
as Latin, German, French, and English.  If the sender's system has a
full Greek character set, but the recipient's does not, then the Greek
characters must all be replaced either by references to entities
or by transliterations into Latin characters (e.g. using the beta code
transliteration developed for the Thesaurus Linguæ
Græcæ).  If the text is later transmitted to another
system which does have a full Greek character set, the transliterated
text or entity references may be translated, under control of the
relevant writing system declarations, into the local Greek character
set.
 </p><p><span id="id2578917"/>As a final example, consider a document written in Japanese, to be
transmitted over a network within Japan, or over an international
network to a recipient in Europe.  Since networks within Japan transmit
Japanese text without information loss, and common utilities may be used
to recognize any of the existing coded character sets and translate into
another, the transmission character set for interchange within Japan may
be the same as the system character set.  (If user-defined extensions
are defined, in order to allow the encoding of kanji not present in the
standard character sets, then these non-standard kanji may need to be
replaced either by entity references or by
‘transliterations’ into the standard character sets,
and the description of the kanji themselves should accompany the
documents in which they are used; the writing system declaration may be
used for this purpose.)
 </p><p><span id="id2578940"/>When transmitting Japanese text outside Japan, the limitations of the
networks at the time of transmission must be taken into account; it may
be necessary to transliterate the text, or to replace non-transmissible
characters with entity references.  
 </p></div><div class="div2" id="NHNON"><h4>24.3.3  Non-Negotiated Interchange</h4><p><span id="id2578960"/>In some cases, no negotiation between interchange partners is
possible, because they do not know each other's identities.  Since it is
impossible to discover an appropriate transmission entity set by
experiment, such interchange requires the use of extremely conservative
assumptions about the frailties of network gateways.
 </p><div class="p"><span id="id2578970"/>Specifically, it is recommended that for non-negotiated interchange
the following practices be adopted:
<ul><li>The transmission character set should be the International
Reference Version of ISO 646 (commonly known as ASCII), or Unicode.  
</li><li>The transmission entity set should include only entities
documented in ISO standard entity sets, published TEI writing system
declarations, or writing system declarations made available with the
material.</li><li>All applicable writing system declarations should be distributed
together with the material they describe; in non-negotiated interchange,
all writing system declarations should assume ISO 646 (IRV) or Unicode as
the system character set.</li><li>For SGML, the SGML declaration distributed with the material should assume
ISO 646 (IRV) as the system character set. </li><li>If the receiver is not using ISO 646 IRV or Unicode as the system character
set, then the receiver (or some intervening network node) must translate
from ISO 646 into the receiver's system character set.  For SGML, the receiver or
the receiver's unpacking software is responsible for rewriting those
parts of the SGML declaration which are dependent on the coded character
set, and ensuring that they work properly on the receiving system.</li><li>As transmitted, the document should be valid.</li></ul></div><p><span id="id2579020"/>By these restrictions, 
these recommendations ensure that documents interchanged in this way
will be directly usable on a great variety of systems; moreover, since
the allowed character sets are widely known and well documented, users of other systems will
normally be able to adjust the documentation and data stream to their
local systems without difficulty.
 </p><p><span id="id2579030"/>It should be noted that ISO 646 imposes a very
restrictive and cumbersome encoding for researchers whose character
sets have a large repertoire; it is strongly recommended, therefore,
that such materials use XML and Unicode, or that arrangements for 
their interchange involve explicitly
negotiated interchange formats wherever possible.
 </p><div class="p"><span id="id2579040"/>The rules given here for non-negotiated interchange are not
guaranteed to succeed, and negotiation of interchange formats is
therefore <em>required</em>, if any of the following apply:
<ul><li>The communications link between the interchange partners garbles
or corrupts any characters of ISO 646 (IRV), (i.e., ISO 646 (IRV) is
not a subset of the transmission character set).</li><li>The communications link maps characters not in the repertoire of
ISO 646 (IRV) onto characters in that repertoire.
 </li><li>The document uses a non-standard SGML concrete syntax (XML
does not permit variant concrete syntaxes, so this case does not
apply when using XML).
 </li></ul></div></div><div class="div2" id="NHCOMP"><h4>24.3.4  Notes for Implementors</h4><div class="p"><span id="id2579084"/>The descriptions of document interchange in this chapter from time to
time refer to software used to pack documents for interchange, or to
unpack documents upon receipt.  The descriptions do not characterize any
specific existing software, but attempt to make clear how such software
must work, in a general way.  It is hoped that the descriptions will be
useful to implementors of packing and unpacking software, but the full
specification of such packing and unpacking software is beyond the scope
of this chapter.  All that can be attempted here is to describe some
complications which may arise in the packing and unpacking of documents
for interchange, of which implementors of such software should be aware.
Most of these difficulties do not arise with XML, because XML requires
that the character set be Unicode.
<ul><li>if the sender and receiver use different SGML syntaxes, various
incompatibilities may be encountered which will require one partner or
the other to modify the SGML syntax used for the document, or the
document itself, or both.  In general, unless other arrangements are
made, the responsibility for such modifications falls upon the receiver
of the document.</li><li>in particular, if the SGML syntax has been modified to expand the
set of legal name characters (e.g. to allow characters with diacritic
marks to occur in SGML names), then either the recipient must similarly
modify the local SGML declaration, or the SGML names must be modified
(by sender or receiver) to make them legal under the recipient's SGML
declaration; name collisions must be carefully avoided when this is
done.</li><li>if the transmission character set does not include all characters
with special meaning to the parser (name characters, delimiters, etc.), then
although the packed document will be in a one-to-one relationship with a
conforming document, it will not itself be conforming.  
In this case, validation must be done by the
sender before packing, and the recipient cannot validate the received
document before unpacking it.</li><li>the proper packing of characters for transport may vary from
language to language: in English text, a left square bracket may need
to be packed with an entity reference to <span class="ident-ge">lbr</span>,
while the same bracket may have a different meaning, and thus a
different entity replacement, in Greek text.  In general, this means
the packing should be done by an application able to detect element boundaries, 
read the value of the
<span class="att">xml:lang</span> attribute from the start-tag or infer it from context,
and adjust its actions appropriately. If only one WSD is in use in a
given document and no language shifts are present, then both packing
and unpacking may be done by a much simpler string-replacement
algorithm.  </li></ul></div></div></div><div class="div1" id="SH"><h3>24.4  The TEI Header and Other Metadata Standards</h3><p><span id="id2579182"/>Many libraries, text repositories, research sites and related
institutions with collections of TEI documents need to map, or export,
metadata from the TEI header to other metadata formats such as 
MARC, Dublin Core (DC), or MODS.  The increasing momentum behind recent efforts
such as the Z39.50 Bath Profile (interoperability) (<a class="link_ptr" href="http://www.collectionscanada.ca/bath/bp-current.htm" title=""><span>http://www.collectionscanada.ca/bath/bp-current.htm</span></a>) and the
Open Archive Initiative (OAI) (<a class="link_ptr" href="http://www.openarchives.org/" title=""><span>http://www.openarchives.org/</span></a>), which facilitate the automated
publishing, harvesting, and aggregation of digital object metadata,
increases the need for such mappings.</p><p><span id="id2579205"/>This section of the Guidelines outlines practices recommended for
encoders (especially those responsible for the documentation of text)
and catalogers when creating TEI headers that will require mapping to
other schema and specifies the set of recommended elements that should
be included to facilitate such mappings.  It also discusses the
relationship between TEI headers elements and MARC fields and between
TEI elements and Dublin Core elements, to facilitate cataloguing of
TEI documents and the loading of TEI header metadata into MARC-based
bibliographic databases, HTML/XHTML <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tags, OAI data
providers, or other metadata systems.
</p><div class="div2" id="SHDEF"><h4>24.4.1  Principles for Encoders</h4><p><span id="id2579235"/>The richness and size of the header reflect the diversity of uses
to which electronic texts conforming to these Guidelines will be put.
As described in section <a class="link_ptr" href="HD.html#HD7" title="Minimal and Recommended Headers">3.6  Minimal and Recommended Headers
 </a>, the TEI header allows for
the provision of a very large amount of information concerning the
text itself, its source, encodings, and revisions as well as detailed
descriptive information that can be used by researchers in analysing
the text.  The richness of the header will depend on the nature and
intended use of the text.  At one extreme, an encoder may expect that
the header will only provide bibliographic information about the text
adequate to local needs.  At the other, wishing to ensure that their
texts can be used for the widest range of applications, encoders will
want to document as explicitly as possible both bibliographic and
descriptive information in such a way that no prior or ancillary
knowledge about the text is needed in order to process it.  The
header, in the latter case, will be very full, approximating the kind
of documentation often supplied in the form of a manual.  Most texts
will lie somewhere between these extremes; textual corpora in
particular will tend toward the latter extreme.</p><div class="p"><span id="id2579281"/>For a successful and complete mapping from the TEI header to other
standards and formats, the TEI header should be as complete as
possible.   When deciding which information
to include in a TEI header that will be mapped to another metadata
standard and the format or structure of that header information, the
following should be kept in mind:
<ul><li>The header should provide full bibliographic information on the
encoded text, its source, where the text can be located, and any
restrictions governing its use.</li><li>The header should contain useful information about the encoding of
the text itself.  In this regard, it is highly recommended that the
encoding description be as complete as possible.  The Guidelines do
not require that the encoding description be included in the header
(since some simple transcriptions of small items may not require it),
but in practice a header without an encoding description
would prove difficult mor impossible to map satisfactorily to most other
metadata formats.</li><li>The header should be amenable to automatic processing, particularly
for loading into databases and for the creation of publications,
indexes, and finding aids, without undue editorial intervention.  For
this reason, two recommendations are made regarding the format or
structure of the header: first, where there is a choice between a
prose content model and one that contains a formal series of
specialized elements, <em>wherever possible and appropriate the
specialized elements should be preferred to unstructured prose</em>.
For instance, the source description can contain either a free-prose
citation (tagged <code>&lt;bibl&gt;</code> or even <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>) or a
<code>&lt;biblStruct&gt;</code> element, which provides a more rigorous structure
for the bibliographic information (see examples in section <a class="link_ptr" href="CO.html#COBI" title="Bibliographic Citations and References">4.11  Bibliographic Citations and References</a>).  The more structured <code>&lt;biblStruct&gt;</code> element is
more suitable for automatic processing, and is therefore recommended
over the less structured alternatives whenever the header is to be
mapped to another standard.  Second, with respect to corpora,
information about each of the texts within a corpus should be included
in the overall corpus-level <code>&lt;teiHeader&gt;</code>.  That is, source
information, editorial practices, encoding descriptions, and the like
should be included in the relevant sections of the corpus
<code>&lt;teiHeader&gt;</code>, with pointers to them from the headers of the
individual texts included in the corpus.  There are three reasons for
this recommendation: first, the corpus-level header will contain the
full array of bibliographic and documentary information for each of
the texts in a corpus, and thus be of great benefit to remote users,
who may have access only to metadata from the corpus-level header;
second, such a layout is easier for the coder to maintain than
searching for information throughout a text; and third, generally
speaking, this practice results in greater overall consistency,
especially with respect to bibliographic citations.</li></ul></div><p><span id="id2579381"/>The distribution and retrieval of TEI header metadata enable
resource discovery by other means. The mappings to MARC and Dublin Core
discussed in the remainder of this section provide two examples of
how TEI header metadata may be re-used and re-purposed.</p></div><div class="div2" id="SHMARC"><h4>24.4.2  Header Elements and their Relationship to the MARC Record</h4><p><span id="id2579416"/>&lt;!-- This entire section is undergoing review by professional catalogers and members of the
TEI in Libraries SIG --&gt;</p><p><span id="id2579426"/>This section offers some guidance to both cataloguers and
bibliographic analysts who want to load metadata from TEI headers into a
MARC-based retrieval system. Because there are variations in
cataloguing practice across local sites, among bibliographic utilities
(such as OCLC and RLIN), and differences in MARC usage in different
countries, only tentative advice is possible. Note that the following
examples are based on USMARC, <em>not</em> UNIMARC.<a class="notelink" href="#Note156"><sup>156</sup></a>
UNIMARC offers cataloguers in different countries the opportunity to
combine different national practices in a single MARC format, and is the
preferred variety of MARC records for distribution
across national boundaries. The implementation of UNIMARC, however,
will be affected by local practice and by guidelines offered by the
bibliographic utilities. Though UNIMARC is a stable format, the
guidelines for its implementation are not sufficiently known or
stabilized to be included in this chapter.</p><p><span id="id2579493"/>There are some major differences between the MARC record and the TEI
header that will cause problems for librarians trying to map from the
TEI header to the MARC record. The most important
difference between the MARC record and the TEI header is the function of
each. <a class="notelink" href="#Note157"><sup>157</sup></a>
The catalogue card is a unitary record for a physical object containing
complex <em>bibliographic data</em> of varying sorts. The catalogue
card points to the physical object. The TEI header provides full
bibliographic information (as would a card), as well as documentary
non-bibliographic information that supports the analysis, either by
humans or machines, of the electronic text documented by header. Most
of this analytical information, which is found in the profile description,
encoding description, and revision history, has little direct provision
for it in the MARC record,
and if retained must be recorded as unstructured notes (55XX) fields.
Notes fields usually do not have the structure to support machine
retrieval and analysis, while properly formatted profile, encoding, and
revision descriptions lend themselves to retrieval, can support machine
processing (including analysis), and point directly to the electronic
text attached to the header. Moreover, the electronic text points back
to the relevant elements in the header.</p><p><span id="id2579566"/>Though this section offers some advice on where the profile,
encoding, and revision descriptions might go in a MARC record, for
practical reasons a repository might want create a codebook from these
divisions of the header, and create a MARC record from the file
description only. The MARC record should contain a reference to the
codebook.</p><p><span id="id2579576"/>Subfields (or delimiters) are conventionally indicated by the
dollar sign.</p><div class="div3" id="SHFD"><h5>24.4.2.1  MARC Fields for the File Description</h5><div class="p"><span id="id2579593"/>Note that there is no provision for the ‘Main
Entry’ (or USMARC <span class="ident-field">1XX</span> fields) in the TEI
header. The main entry should be constructed, using appropriate name
authority control, by the cataloguer from information derived from the
header that indicates who is primarily responsible for the
intellectual content of the work. There is an <code>&lt;author&gt;</code> element,
but the form of the name will have to be checked by a cataloguer
before the main entry is constructed.
<dl><dt><code>&lt;titleStmt&gt;</code></dt><dd> corresponds to title and statement of

‘Physical Description’ MARC field.  Fields

appropriate, depending on local practice. 
The children of the <code>&lt;publicationStmt&gt;</code> element may be put in MARC <span class="ident-field">260</span>.  The

<code>&lt;address&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;idno&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;availability&gt;</code>.
Restrictions on access should normally be placed in the
<span class="ident-field">506</span> field, while the place where an item may be ordered
will be located in a local notes (<span class="ident-field">590</span>) field.  If local
practice warrants it, the address of the publisher should be indicated
in the <span class="ident-field">260</span> field.
</p><p><span id="id2579989"/>The series <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> and the <code>&lt;idno&gt;</code> should be placed in
the appropriate <span class="ident-field">490</span> fields (series untraced), if series
authority checking needs to be done.  Further, because the TEI elements do
not differentiate between name, conference, or title series, there is
no simple mechanical method for determining which MARC tag (<span class="ident-field">410,
411,</span> etc.)  should be used.  Safe practice would be to load any
series statements into <span class="ident-field">490</span> fields, and then to conduct
authority work on those fields.

(<span class="ident-field">5XX</span>) fields.</p><p><span id="id2580037"/>The <code>&lt;sourceDesc&gt;</code> can be mapped to be a ‘source of
data’ note (<span class="ident-field">537</span> in RLIN MDF format) with the
print constant ‘Transcribed from:’ at the beginning of the note. 
The <code>&lt;biblStruct&gt;</code> itself can be mapped onto a <span class="ident-field">581</span>
field (note on primary publication) using the ISBD format to separate
each data element.</p><div class="p"><span id="id2580076"/>The <code>&lt;scriptStmt&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;recordingStmt&gt;</code>,
<code>&lt;recording&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;equipment&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;broadcast&gt;</code>
elements do not easily map to existing MARC fields, and should be
put into a local notes field (<span class="ident-field">590</span>) treating the TEI element
introducing each component as a print constant at the head of the
field in order to facilitate future local processing and retrieval.
Example:

header for librarian cataloguers, because it provides a detailed
description of the <em>non-bibliographic</em> aspects of the text,
specifically the languages and sublanguages used, the situation in which
it was produced, and the participants and their setting.  This
information can be used for retrieval purposes or in
machine-supported analysis of the text.  The information can be loaded
into a separate ‘codebook’ and referenced by the MARC
record.  While some components of the profile description have clear counterparts in MARC, little guidance can be offered on the appropriate MARC
location for many of the elements that make up the profile description. One option is
to load the profile description into a
MARC record for archival and possibly retrieval purposes, then the
contents of the profile description may be mapped into a locally-defined
notes field (<span class="ident-field">59X</span>) with its TEI tagging intact, as in the examples
above.

the file.  Aside from the edition area of the MARC record, there are
no MARC fields that deal specifically with changes of this sort.  This
information might be best included in a ‘codebook’,
rather than a MARC record. As before, the simplest way of approaching
this problem is to include the material with its TEI tagging intact as a
locally-defined note (<span class="ident-field">59X</span>) in order to support future
local processing.</p></div></div><div class="div2" id="SHDC"><h4>24.4.3  Header Elements and their Relationship to Dublin Core</h4><p><span id="id2580564"/>

    using XML to encode textual features which do not take a strictly
    hierarchical form: that is, features which do not necessarily nest within
    other features. This chapter provides an overview of several techniques for
    handling such problems, and should be consulted when deciding how to deal
    with them.</p><div class="p"><span id="id2580664"/>The following examples illustrate the type of problem with which this
    chapter is concerned: <ul><li><p><span id="id2580675"/>in narrative, a speech by a character may begin in the middle of a
          paragraph and continue for several more paragraphs</p></li><li><p><span id="id2580684"/>in a verse text, the encoder may need to tag both the formal
          structure of the verse (its stanzas and lines) and its syntactic
          structures (which sometimes nest within the metrical structure and
          sometimes cross metrical boundaries)</p></li><li><p><span id="id2580694"/>in any kind of text, the encoder may wish to record the physical
          structure of volume, page, column, and line, as well as the formal or
          logical structure of chapters and paragraphs or acts and scenes,
        etc.</p></li><li><p><span id="id2580705"/>in verse drama, the structure of acts, scenes, and speeches often
          conflicts with the metrical structure</p></li><li><p><span id="id2580713"/>in any kind of text, an embedded text (e.g. a play within a play, or
          a song) may be interrupted by other matter; the encoder may wish to
          establish explicitly the logical unity of the embedded material (e.g.
          to identify the song as a single song, and to mark its internal formal
          structure)</p></li><li><p><span id="id2580725"/>in a dictionary, different types of information (e.g. orthography,
          syllabification, and hyphenation) may be combined within a single
          notation; the encoder may wish both to preserve the presentation of
          the material in the source text and to disentangle the logically
          distinct pieces of information in the interests of more convenient
          processing of the lexical information</p></li></ul></div><p><span id="id2580740"/>Many other examples might be given, but these should suffice to show the
    variety of applications where non-hierarchical or non-nesting information
    appears, and to illustrate the various methods for addressing the problem.</p><p><span id="id2580748"/>Non-nesting information poses fundamental problems for any encoding scheme,
    and it must be stated at the outset that no solution has yet been suggested
    which combines all the desirable attributes of formal simplicity, capacity
    to represent all occurring or imaginable kinds of structures, suitability
    for formal or mechanical validation, and clear identity with the notations
    needed for simpler cases (i.e. cases where the textual features do nest
    properly). The representation of non-hierarchical information is thus
    necessarily a matter of choices among alternatives, of trade-offs between
    various sets of different advantages and disadvantages.</p><div class="p"><span id="id2580775"/>There are several methods used within these Guidelines to handle
    non-nesting information: <ul><li><p><span id="id2580785"/>redundant encoding of information in multiple forms</p></li><li><p><span id="id2580793"/>remodeling of the document structure</p></li><li><p><span id="id2580799"/>boundary elements: empty elements which mark the boundaries between
          elements in a non-nesting structure</p></li><li><p><span id="id2580807"/>fragmentation of an item: the division of what logically is a single
          element into two or more parts, each of which nests properly within
          its context</p></li><li><p><span id="id2580817"/>virtual joins: the recreation of a virtual element from fragments of
          text, possibly discontinuous or out of order</p></li></ul></div><p><span id="id2580827"/>In the sections which follow these techniques are described, and their
    advantages and disadvantages are briefly discussed. The various solutions to
    the problem will be exemplified using extracts of two poems as examples.</p><div class="p"><span id="id2580835"/>A stanza of a poem written by the Italian Nobel prize winner Salvatore
    Quasimodo serves as a first example: <div class="blockquote"><div class="l">E l'orma dell'acqua è l'alba</div><div class="l">sulla riva. Si esauriva in me</div><div class="l">il supplizio della sabbia,</div><div class="l">a batticuore, spaziando la notte.</div></div> This stanza contains four metrical lines and two sentences. The
    metrical lines can be considered part of a metrical
    view of the text, the sentences part of a linguistic
    view. The first sentence ends in the middle of the second line.</div><div class="p"><span id="id2580873"/>A stanza of a German ballad written by Friedrich Schiller serves as a
    second example. As in the first example, sentence structure and line
    structure of this stanza will be regarded. In Schiller's ballad, in addition
    to sentences and lines, there is direct discourse which one might want to
    annotate. <div class="blockquote"><div class="l">“Was wollt ihr?” ruft er, für Schrecken bleich,</div><div class="l">“Ich habe nichts als mein Leben,</div><div class="l">Das muß ich dem Könige geben!”</div><div class="l">Und entreißt die Keule dem nächsten gleich:</div><div class="l">“Um des Freundes willen erbarmet euch!”</div><div class="l">Und drei mit gewaltigen Streichen</div><div class="l">Erlegt er, die andern entweichen.</div></div></div><p><span id="id2580919"/>Thus, there are three ‘views’ that we will discuss in
    the following sections. The first view concerns itself with the metrical
    structure of the poetry. In encoding this view of the poems one is likely to
    be interested in metrical lines, stanzas, cantos, rhyming schemes, scansion
    patterns, etc. For the purposes of this discussion we will call this view
    the metrical view, and encode only the metrical lines
    and stanzas.</p><p><span id="id2580938"/>The second view concerns itself with the linguistic structure of the text
    — phonemes, morphemes, words, phrases, clauses, and sentences are
    likely to be of interest to those encoding this view. However, here we will
    only encode sentences in what we refer to as the
    linguistic view.</p><p><span id="id2580958"/>The third view, which we will call the vocal view,
    is concerned with direct speech or quotations; whether the text is in the
    narrator's voice or a character's voice. Here we will not attempt to
    differentiate which character is speaking. Note that in the example above,
    the passages that are not in the narrator's voice are enclosed in quotation
    marks, not encoded with a <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> element.</p><div class="div2" id="NHME"><h4>24.6.1  Multiple Encodings of the Same Information</h4><p><span id="id2580989"/>Conceptually, the simplest method of disentangling two (or more)
      conflicting hierarchical views of the same information is to encode it
      twice (or more often), each time capturing a single view.</p><div class="p"><span id="id2580997"/>The metrical view of each stanza is straight-forwardly encoded using the
        <code>&lt;lg&gt;</code> element to encode the stanza, and an <code>&lt;l&gt;</code> element to
      encode each metrical line. Here is the passage by Quasimodo:
      <div class="pre"> <span class="element">&lt;lg <span class="attribute">type</span>="stanza"&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;l&gt;</span>E l'orma dell'acqua è l'alba<span class="element">&lt;/l&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;l&gt;</span>sulla riva. Si esauriva in me<span class="element">&lt;/l&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;l&gt;</span>il supplizio della sabbia,<span class="element">&lt;/l&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;l&gt;</span>a batticuore, spaziando la notte.<span class="element">&lt;/l&gt;</span><br/> <span class="element">&lt;/lg&gt;</span></div>
      The passage by Schiller is structurally very similar in this view:
      <div class="pre"> <span class="element">&lt;lg <span class="attribute">type</span>="stanza"&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;l&gt;</span>“Was wollt ihr?” ruft er, für Schrecken bleich,<span class="element">&lt;/l&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;l&gt;</span>“Ich habe nichts als mein Leben,<span class="element">&lt;/l&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;l&gt;</span>Das muß ich dem Könige geben!”<span class="element">&lt;/l&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;l&gt;</span>Und entreißt die Keule dem nächsten gleich:<span class="element">&lt;/l&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;l&gt;</span>“Um des Freundes willen erbarmet euch!”<span class="element">&lt;/l&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;l&gt;</span>Und drei mit gewaltigen Streichen<span class="element">&lt;/l&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;l&gt;</span>Erlegt er, die andern entweichen.<span class="element">&lt;/l&gt;</span><br/> <span class="element">&lt;/lg&gt;</span></div></div><div class="p"><span id="id2581296"/>An encoding of the second passage above with respect to the vocal view
      follows.
      <div class="pre"> <span class="element">&lt;p&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;q&gt;</span>Was wollt ihr?<span class="element">&lt;/q&gt;</span> ruft er, für Schrecken bleich, <br/>   <span class="element">&lt;q&gt;</span>Ich habe nichts als mein Leben, 
  Das muß ich dem Könige geben!<span class="element">&lt;/q&gt;</span><br/>   Und entreißt die Keule dem nächsten gleich:<br/>   <span class="element">&lt;q&gt;</span>Um des Freundes willen erbarmet euch!<span class="element">&lt;/q&gt;</span><br/>   Und drei mit gewaltigen Streichen<br/>   Erlegt er, die andern entweichen.<br/> <span class="element">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div>
      Of course, this view does not make sense for the Italian poem, which does
      not contain direct discourse.</div><div class="p"><span id="id2581328"/>A third annotation marks up linguistic categories, particularly the
      sentences. Focusing on the linguistic structure, the first stanza can be
      regarded as a paragraph containing two sentences:
      <div class="pre"> <span class="element">&lt;p&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;s&gt;</span>E l'orma dell'acqua è l'alba sulla riva.<span class="element">&lt;/s&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;s&gt;</span>Si esauriva in me il supplizio della sabbia, a batticuore, 
    spaziando la notte.<span class="element">&lt;/s&gt;</span><br/> <span class="element">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div>
      Respectively, one might want to annotate the second example in the
      linguistic perspective, as follows: <div class="pre"> <span class="element">&lt;p&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;q&gt;</span><br/>   <span class="element">&lt;s <span class="attribute">type</span>="quest"&gt;</span>Was wollt ihr?<span class="element">&lt;/s&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;/q&gt;</span> ruft er, für Schrecken bleich,<br/>   <span class="element">&lt;q&gt;</span><br/>   <span class="element">&lt;s <span class="attribute">type</span>="emph"&gt;</span>Ich habe nichts als mein Leben, 
    Das muß ich dem Könige geben!<span class="element">&lt;/s&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;/q&gt;</span><br/> <span class="element">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div></div><p><span id="id2581384"/>The advantages of this method of markup are that each way of looking at
      the information is explicitly represented in the data, and may be
      processed in straightforward ways, without requiring complex methods of
      disentangling information relevant to one view from information relevant
      only to other views. Typically each view is straight forward to encode.</p><p><span id="id2581395"/>However, this method has several obvious drawbacks. It requires redundant
      information be encoded, with the resulting risk that one view may be
      updated without corresponding changes being made to the others, resulting
      in inconsistencies within the document. Moreover, it is difficult to
      access information from one view while processing the file that contains
      the encoding of another, because the files are not related to each other,
      at least not directly. It has been shown, however, that it is possible to
      relate the different annotations in an indirect way: if the textual
      content of the annotations is identical, the very text can serve as a
      means for linking the different annotations.
      </p></div><div class="div2" id="NHRM"><h4>24.6.2  Remodeling of the document class</h4><div class="p"><span id="id2581428"/>Sometimes it is possible to merge several logical hierarchies into one
      physical hierarchy. In one of the examples, the stanza of Schiller's
      ballad, such a merged document might look as follows: <div class="pre_eg">&lt;!-- markup uses TEI names, but is not valid --&gt;
&lt;lg type="stanza"&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;s type="quest"&gt;Was wollt ihr?&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/q&gt;
    ruft er, für Schrecken bleich,&lt;/l&gt; 
  &lt;q&gt;&lt;s type="emph"&gt;&lt;l&gt;Ich habe nichts als mein Leben,&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;Das muß ich dem Könige geben!&lt;/l&gt;&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/q&gt;
  &lt;!-- ... --&gt;
&lt;/lg&gt;</div></div><p><span id="id2581440"/>In this case, there exists a single hierarchy containing all the
      information of the three separate annotations given above, but the single
      hierarchy does not conform to the TEI document grammar. The first line
      contains a quote which itself contains a sentence. In contrast to the
      first line, the second and third lines are contained in a sentence. This
      is a strange analysis, which is consequently not legitimated by the TEI
      document type.</p><p><span id="id2581458"/>Even if such an annotation were valid, many overlapping structures exist
      which cannot be annotated in this way. This can be seen in the second
      example: the sentence E l'orma dell'acqua è
        l'alba sulla riva. ends in the middle of line 2. Thus there
      is neither a line which contains a whole sentence nor a sentence which
      contains a whole line.</p></div><div class="div2" id="NHBM"><h4>24.6.3  Boundary Marking with Empty Elements</h4><div class="p"><span id="id2581490"/>Usually a span of text, or a ‘content object’, is
      annotated by encoding it as an XML element which has a start-tag at the
      beginning of the span and an end-tag at the end. It is possible to encode a
      span of text using an empty tag at the beginning and another empty tag at
      the end. The empty tags used at each end are called <em>segment boundary
        elements</em>. There are several variations on this method of
      encoding: <dl><dt>Segment-Boundary Elements</dt><dd>All segment boundary delimiter elements are of the same generic
          type (e.g., <code>&lt;boundary&gt;</code>). The type of textual feature being
          encoded, and whether any given tag is the start or end of said
          feature, is encoded in attribute values (e.g., a <span class="att">type</span>
          attribute may be used to indicate the textual feature, and a
            <span class="att">position</span> attribute might take the values <span class="val">start</span>
          and <span class="val">end</span>).</dd><dt>Paired Segment-Boundary Elements</dt><dd>The name of the segment-boundary elements reflect whether they
          indicate the beginning of a passage or the end. E.g.,
            <code>&lt;boundary-start&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;boundary-end&gt;</code>. As with single

          used if there were not an overlap problem. E.g., instead of
            <code>&lt;q-boundary&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;speech-boundary&gt;</code>, the normal
          elements <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;speech&gt;</code> would be used as empty
          elements, with special attributes to indicate which is the beginning
          and which is the end. Furthermore, each empty element that marks the
          beginning is explicitly linked to the empty element that marks the
          end, and vice-versa.</dd></dl></div><div class="p"><span id="id2581632"/>For example, if sentences are marked using (user-defined) empty elements
        <code>&lt;sb&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;se&gt;</code>, the empty elements mark the beginning and
      end of the sentences, but because they do not contain the sentence as
      content, sentences can be encoded interspersed with other features that
      overlap sentences, as in the following example of paired typed
      segment-boundary delimiter elements <div class="pre_eg">&lt;lg type="stanza"&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;&lt;sb/&gt;E l'orma dell'acqua è l'alba&lt;/l&gt;

  &lt;l&gt;il supplizio della sabbia,&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;a batticuore, spaziando la notte.&lt;se/&gt;&lt;/l&gt;
&lt;/lg&gt;</div></div><div class="p"><span id="id2581653"/>Each of the various methods described above (except for COLT) has the
      disadvantage that it is difficult to tell which start element corresponds
      to which end element without a complex processing of the text. One way to
      improve on this situation would be to use the linking attribute
        <span class="att">corresp</span> discussed in <a class="link_ptr" href="SA.html#SACS1" title="Correspondence">11.4.1  Correspondence</a> to associate the
      boundary element indicating the end of a given sentence with that
      indicating its start, as follows: <div class="pre_eg">&lt;lg type="stanza"&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;&lt;sb xml:id='s1'/&gt;E l'orma dell'acqua è l'alba&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;sulla riva.&lt;se corresp='#s1'/&gt; &lt;sb xml:id='s2'/&gt;Si esauriva in me&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;il supplizio della sabbia,&lt;/l&gt;
  &lt;l&gt;a batticuore, spaziando la notte.&lt;se corresp='#s2'/&gt;&lt;/l&gt;
&lt;/lg&gt;</div></div><p><span id="id2581682"/>This method has the advantage of simplicity; it provides all the
      information needed to reconstruct all the competing hierarchical views of
      the text. Often the only processing required for an element occurs at its
      start and end (or can easily be formulated to do so); this markup method
      handles those cases well.</p><p><span id="id2581698"/>In the above example the explicit indication of correspondence is not
      strictly required, because every sentence-end follows its own
      sentence-begin. However, cases do exist where the beginnings and endings do
      not line up so predictably. In these cases, called self-overlap, the
      explicit indication of which beginning corresponds with which end (or
      vice-versa) is necessary.</p><div class="p"><span id="id2581708"/>This example is an extract from the lyrics of a common children's
      clapping game. Here the example is encoded using paired segment boundary
      delimiter elements, in this case <code>&lt;ml&gt;</code> for . <div class="pre_eg">&lt;ml xml:id="L21s" corresp="#L21e" delimit="start"&gt;Hello operator,&lt;ml xml:id="L21e" corresp="#L21s" delimit="end"&gt;

      desired to record the phrases of both possible readings. The encoding
      demonstrates the use of paired segment-boundary elements. Each
      end-boundary indicates its corresponding start-boundary, but the
      start-boundaries do not indicate their ends.<div class="pre_eg">&lt;start type="phr" xml:id="phrase01"/&gt;&lt;start type="phr" xml:id="phraseA"/&gt;Broadway&lt;end type="phr" corresp="#phraseA"/&gt;

run&lt;end type="phr" corresp="#phraseB"/&gt;&lt;end type="phr" corresp="#phrase02"/&gt;</div></div><div class="p"><span id="id2581749"/>COLT is an interesting variant of the paired segment boundary delimiter
      technique. The two differences are <ol><li>the type of element used as the empty segment boundary delimiter
          element is the same element that would normally be used to encode the
          feature if there were no overlap problem; and</li><li>each segment boundary that marks the beginning of a passage is
          explicitly linked to the segment boundary element that marks its end,
          and vice-versa.</li></ol> So instead of using <code>&lt;ml&gt;</code> in the above example, the normal
      TEI <code>&lt;l&gt;</code> element is used, only without content so that it functions
      not as a container for the metrical line, but just as an indication of the
      start and end of the metrical line. This is possible because each element
      which allows text content (also called mixed content), i.e. all elements
      which can be affected by overlap, can also have no content at all.<a class="notelink" href="#Note158"><sup>158</sup></a> Therefore all relevant elements can be used as empty segment
      boundary delimiter elements. However, it is still necessary to use an
      attribute to indicate whether a segment boundary delimiter element is a
      start-boundary or an end-boundary. Furthermore, when using the same
      element both in its normal role as a container and as a segment boundary
      delimiter it is advisable to use an attribute other than the general
      purpose <span class="att">corresp</span> attribute to indicate the corresponding start-
      or end-tag. Thus in COLT the <span class="att">sID</span> and <span class="att">eID</span> attributes
      are used for both of these purposes: Nonethe name of the attribute informs users (and programs) for which
          kind of tag the empty element is substituting: <span class="att">sID</span> for
          start-tag and <span class="att">eID</span> for end tag, 
      and the value of the attribute indicates where the corresponding end-
          or start-tag is, by co-reference; i.e. the element whose
          <span class="att">sID</span> value matches the current element's <span class="att">eID</span>
          value is its start-tag. <a class="notelink" href="#Note159"><sup>159</sup></a></div><div class="p"><span id="id2581866"/>Besides the already mentioned non-need to introduce new, somehow
      artificial elements, this special use of empty elements has the advantage
      that they use the same element name as the normal container elements. This
      has at least two positive consequences: Nonethe human reader of the markup immediately knows what the segment
          boundary stands for and , 
      and the segment boundary element has exactly the same attribute
          definition as the container element.</div><div class="p"><span id="id2581891"/>Here is the same ambiguous newspaper headline as above encoded with COLT

      Quasimodo's poem, the linguistic and the metrical view. The element
      <code>&lt;s&gt;</code> is used as an empty element and serves as a segment boundary
      delimiter: </p><div class="pre"> <span class="element">&lt;lg <span class="attribute">type</span>="stanza"&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;l&gt;</span><br/>   <span class="element">&lt;s <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="sb1" <span class="attribute">corresp</span>="#se1"/&gt;</span>E l'orma dell'acqua è l'alba<span class="element">&lt;/l&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;l&gt;</span>sulla riva.<span class="element">&lt;s <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="se1" <span class="attribute">corresp</span>="#sb1"/&gt;</span><br/>   <span class="element">&lt;s <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="sb2" <span class="attribute">corresp</span>="#se2"/&gt;</span>Si esauriva in me<span class="element">&lt;/l&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;l&gt;</span>il supplizio della sabbia,<span class="element">&lt;/l&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;l&gt;</span>a batticuore, spaziando la notte.<span class="element">&lt;s <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="se2" <span class="attribute">corresp</span>="#sb2"/&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;/l&gt;</span><br/> <span class="element">&lt;/lg&gt;</span></div><p><span id="id2581967"/>Together with the use of the attributes <span class="att">xml:id</span> and
        <span class="att">corresp</span> this allows not only for using all of the relevant
      TEI-elements as segment boundary delimiters, but also to do so without
      introducing attributes. </p><p><span id="id2581982"/>The information contained in the attribute names <span class="att">sID</span> and
        <span class="att">eID</span> is included implicitly: the first element of a matching
      pair is the start element, the other empty element plays the role of a
      closing element.<a class="notelink" href="#Note160"><sup>160</sup></a></p><p><span id="id2582013"/>Despite their advantages, segment boundary delimiters incur the
      disadvantage of cumbersome processing: since the elements of the analysis
      (e.g. the sentences in the poems) are not uniformly represented by nodes
      in the document tree, they must be reconstituted by software in an ad hoc
      fashion, which is likely to be difficult and may be error prone.</p><p><span id="id2582024"/>Most important for some encoders, this method disguises the logical
      relationship between the beginning and the ending of each logical element.
      This makes it impossible for standard validation software to provide the
      same kind of validation possible elsewhere in the encoding. When using
      grammar based schema languages it is not possible to define a content
      model for the range limited by empty elements.<a class="notelink" href="#Note161"><sup>161</sup></a></p></div><div class="div2" id="NHVE"><h4>24.6.4  Fragmentation of Elements and Reconstitution of Virtual Elements</h4><p><span id="id2582062"/>Fragmentation breaks up what might be considered a single element into
      multiple smaller elements, in order to make it fit within the hierarchy.
      If a passage of direct discourse begins in the middle of one paragraph and
      continues for several more paragraphs, for example, one could encode the
      passage as a series of <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> elements. This has the effect that the
      document contains more <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> elements than there are passages of
      direct speech. If one wants to count the quotations by counting the
      <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> elements, this is a drawback. To the extent that the element
      being broken up is used primarily to signal some characteristic, (e.g.
      that of being spoken by a character other than the narrator) rather than
      some countable object, this drawback is rather minor. Direct discourse is
      in fact so frequently interrupted by narrative interruptions, including
      but not limited to reporting clauses like he said,
      that the number of <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> elements is unlikely to correspond precisely
      to the number of utterances, speaker turns, or any other observable unit
      of conversation. However, since the technique of fragmentation is a
      general technique to avoid overlapping markup, the effect of introducing
      artificially new instances of a particular element must be kept in mind.
      When applied to the encoding of e.g. sentences, pages, or entries in a
      dictionary the mismatch between the annotated phenomenon and the number of
      instances of the element may be more problematic.</p><div class="p"><span id="id2582109"/>To tag one of our examples with this method, the speech can be broken up
      to fit into the series of lines:
      <div class="pre"> <span class="element">&lt;lg <span class="attribute">type</span>="stanza"&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;l&gt;</span><br/>   <span class="element">&lt;q&gt;</span>Was wollt ihr?<span class="element">&lt;/q&gt;</span> ruft er, für Schrecken bleich,<span class="element">&lt;/l&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;l&gt;</span><br/>   <span class="element">&lt;q&gt;</span>Ich habe nichts als mein Leben,<span class="element">&lt;/q&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;/l&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;l&gt;</span><br/>   <span class="element">&lt;q&gt;</span>Das muß ich dem Könige geben!<span class="element">&lt;/q&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;/l&gt;</span><br/>&lt;!-- ... --&gt;<br/> <span class="element">&lt;/lg&gt;</span></div>
      Here there are three <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> elements to encode two quotations. The
      advantages of this method are that it is simple and that at least one of
      the competing hierarchies can be processed normally.</div><div class="p"><span id="id2582152"/>The technique of fragmentation is often complemented by the technique of
      virtual joins. Virtual joins may be used to combine objects in the text to
      a new hierarchy. Here is the same example with two quotations encoded using
      three <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> elements, but in this case the two <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> elements
      that represent a single quotation are aggregated by use of the
      <span class="att">next</span> and <span class="att">prev</span> attributes described in <a class="link_ptr" href="SA.html#SAAG" title="Aggregation">11.7  Aggregation</a>.
      <div class="pre"> <span class="element">&lt;lg <span class="attribute">type</span>="stanza"&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;l&gt;</span><br/>   <span class="element">&lt;q <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="q1"&gt;</span>Was wollt ihr?<span class="element">&lt;/q&gt;</span> ruft er, für Schrecken bleich,<span class="element">&lt;/l&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;l&gt;</span><br/>   <span class="element">&lt;q <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="q2.1" <span class="attribute">next</span>="#q2.2"&gt;</span>Ich habe nichts als mein Leben,<span class="element">&lt;/q&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;/l&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;l&gt;</span><br/>   <span class="element">&lt;q <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="q2.2" <span class="attribute">prev</span>="#q2.1"&gt;</span>Das muß ich dem Könige geben!<span class="element">&lt;/q&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;/l&gt;</span><br/>&lt;!-- ... --&gt;<br/> <span class="element">&lt;/lg&gt;</span></div></div><div class="pre"> <span class="element">&lt;note <span class="attribute">resp</span>="#aw"&gt;</span>[TODO: Need example using part= here ?? ]<span class="element">&lt;/note&gt;</span></div><p><span id="id2582243"/>The major advantage of this method is that it allows all the hierarchies
      in the text to be handled explicitly, both the privileged one directly
      represented, and the alternate hierarchy which has been split up and
      rejoined. Its major disadvantages are that (like most of the other methods
      described here) it privileges one hierarchy over the others, and requires
      special processing to reconstitute the elements of the other hierarchies.</p></div><div class="div2" id="NHSO"><h4>24.6.5  Stand-off Markup</h4><div class="p"><span id="id2582278"/>Classic use of markup is characterized by embedding the annotation in the
      text. An alternative approach separates the text and the annotation. This
      approach is known as stand-off annotation. See section <a class="link_ptr" href="SA.html#SASO" title="Stand-off Markup">11.9  Stand-off Markup</a> for more information on, and examples of, stand-off markup. Stand-off
      annotation establishes a new hierarchy by building a new tree whose nodes
      are XML elements which do not contain textual content, but rather links to
      another <em>layer</em>: .
      
      This approach can be subdivided according to different criteria. A first
      distinction concerns the link base. Sometimes the link target contains
      markup. Example:
      <div class="pre"> <span class="element">&lt;l&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;q&gt;</span><br/>   <span class="element">&lt;w <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="w78"&gt;</span>Was<span class="element">&lt;/w&gt;</span><br/>   <span class="element">&lt;w <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="w79"&gt;</span>wollt<span class="element">&lt;/w&gt;</span><br/>   <span class="element">&lt;w <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="w80"&gt;</span>ihr<span class="element">&lt;/w&gt;</span>?<span class="element">&lt;/q&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;w <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="w81"&gt;</span>ruft<span class="element">&lt;/w&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;w <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="w82"&gt;</span>er<span class="element">&lt;/w&gt;</span>, <span class="element">&lt;w <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="w83"&gt;</span>für<span class="element">&lt;/w&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;w <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="w84"&gt;</span>Schrecken<span class="element">&lt;/w&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;w <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="w85"&gt;</span>bleich<span class="element">&lt;/w&gt;</span>,<span class="element">&lt;/l&gt;</span><br/> <span class="element">&lt;l&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;q&gt;</span><br/>   <span class="element">&lt;w <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="w86"&gt;</span>Ich<span class="element">&lt;/w&gt;</span><br/>   <span class="element">&lt;w <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="w87"&gt;</span>habe<span class="element">&lt;/w&gt;</span><br/>   <span class="element">&lt;w <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="w88"&gt;</span>nichts<span class="element">&lt;/w&gt;</span><br/>   <span class="element">&lt;w <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="w89"&gt;</span>als<span class="element">&lt;/w&gt;</span><br/>   <span class="element">&lt;w <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="w90"&gt;</span>mein<span class="element">&lt;/w&gt;</span><br/>   <span class="element">&lt;w <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="w91"&gt;</span>Leben<span class="element">&lt;/w&gt;</span>, <br/>  	    <span class="element">&lt;w <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="w92"&gt;</span>Das<span class="element">&lt;/w&gt;</span><br/>   <span class="element">&lt;w <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="w93"&gt;</span> muß<span class="element">&lt;/w&gt;</span><br/>   <span class="element">&lt;w <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="w94"&gt;</span> ich<span class="element">&lt;/w&gt;</span><br/>   <span class="element">&lt;w <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="w95"&gt;</span> dem<span class="element">&lt;/w&gt;</span><br/>   <span class="element">&lt;w <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="w96"&gt;</span> Könige<span class="element">&lt;/w&gt;</span><br/>   <span class="element">&lt;w <span class="attribute">xml:id</span>="w97"&gt;</span>geben<span class="element">&lt;/w&gt;</span>!<span class="element">&lt;/q&gt;</span><br/> <span class="element">&lt;/l&gt;</span></div></div><div class="p"><span id="id2582462"/>The new hierarchy is built up by reference to that base annotation, e.g.
      at the end of the same XML-file: <div class="pre_eg">&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;s&gt;&lt;xi:include href="." xpointer="range(element(w78),element(w80))"/&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;s&gt;&lt;xi:include href="." xpointer="range(element(w81),element(w97))"/&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;</div></div><div class="p"><span id="id2582470"/>Notice how similar this is to the use of <code>&lt;join&gt;</code> elements:
      <div class="pre"> <span class="element">&lt;p&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;join <span class="attribute">targets</span>="#w78 #w79 #w80" <span class="attribute">result</span>="s" <span class="attribute">scope</span>="root"/&gt;</span><br/>  <span class="element">&lt;join<br/>    <span class="attribute">targets</span>="#w81 #w82 #w83 #w84 #w85 #w86 #w87 #w88 #w89             #w90 #w91 #w92 #w93 #w94 #w95 #w96 #w97"/&gt;</span><br/> <span class="element">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div>
      The main advantages of XInclude over <code>&lt;join&gt;</code> are that it is possible
      to specify attributes on the created <code>&lt;s&gt;</code> elements, and that there
      exists off-the-shelf software that will perform XInclude processing.</div><p><span id="id2582513"/>In a different stand-off technique the link-base contains only plain
      text. The range of text to be annotated is indicated by character offsets.
      See <a class="link_ptr" href="SA.html#SATS" title="TEI XPointer Schemes">11.2.4  TEI XPointer Schemes</a>, in particular <a class="link_ptr" href="SA.html#SATSSR" title="string-range(pointer, offset [, length])">11.2.4.5  string-range(pointer, offset [, length])</a>.</p><p><span id="id2582529"/>Another distinction concerns the number of files which can serve as link
      targets. Often, one (dedicated) annotation is used as the link target of
      all the other annotations. It is also possible to freely interlink several
      layers.</p><p><span id="id2582538"/>It has been noted that stand-off markup has several advantages over
      embedded annotations. In particular, it is possible to produce annotations
      of a text even when the source document is read-only. Furthermore,
      annotation files can be distributed without distributing the source text.
      Further advantages mentioned in the literature are that discontinuous
      segments of text can be combined in a single annotation, that independent
      parallel coders can produce independent annotations, and that different
      annotation files can contain different layers of information. Lastly, it
      has also been noted that this approach is elegant.</p><p><span id="id2582553"/>But there are also several drawbacks. First, new stand-off annotated
      layers require a separate interpretation, and the layers —
      although separate — depend on each other. Moreover, although
      all the the information of the multiple hierarchies is included, the
      information may be difficult to access using generic methods.

      do not suffer the problem of the inability to encode overlapping
      hierarchies. These include, but are not limited to the SGML feature
      CONCUR, the powerful MECS or TeXMECS language, and the new LMNL
      meta-language. Since TEI is currently based on XML, and these approaches
      are not XML, they are not described any further in these Guidelines.</p></div><div class="div2" id="NHDI"><h4>24.6.7  Discussion</h4><p><span id="id2582621"/>All proposed solutions of the multiple hierarchy problem have advantages
      as well as drawbacks. For different applications and usage scenarios,
      different solutions may be approriate.</p><ul><li><div class="p"><span id="id2582633"/>For editing purposes the following solutions may be most appropriate:<ul><li>Multiple encodings of the same information </li><li>Remodeling of the document class </li><li>Boundary marking with empty elements </li></ul> The choice of a solution depends on a number of specifics:
            Nonethe number of different views and potential hierarchies, the amount of overlap, how much, if any, customization is required, 
      and how much encoding guidance annotators need from the XML
              editing software. If good (special purpose) software is available it might also
          be appropriate to use stand-off markup or non XML-based solutions.</div></li><li>For processing, the stand-off-approach often is quite easy to
        handle. Several readily available XML tools will perform XInclude
        processing.</li><li>For sustainable storage and easy information transfer redundant
        encoding is desirable. Other formats can be generated by unifying the
        separate annotations. </li></ul></div></div><p class="left"><i> Up: </i><a class="navigation" href="index.html">Contents</a><i> Previous: </i><a class="navigation" href="TD.html">23  Documentation Elements</a><i> Next: </i><a class="navigation" href="REFCLA.html">Appendix A  Classes</a></p><div class="notes"><div class="noteHeading">Notes</div><div class="note"><a id="Note149">149.</a>The recommendations in this chapter are likely to be substantially revised at

interests of XML-conformance.</div><div class="note"><a id="Note152">152.</a>Some will regard such simplifications as useful ways of making it
easier to develop software which accepts TEI-conformant documents;
others will deplore the failure of such software to accept all
TEI-conformant documents including those which extend the TEI DTD.  In
providing the notion of <em>DTD extension</em> for describing what
documents are and are not accepted by such software, the TEI acts in
the belief that such software will in fact be developed; it neither
endorses nor deplores its construction or use.</div><div class="note"><a id="Note153">153.</a>See document TEI PC P1 ‘The Preparation of Text Encoding

revised, and will probably be
withdrawn or substantially modified at the next release.</div><div class="note"><a id="Note156">156.</a>For

          the TEI schemas. It is possible to write schemas in other languages
          (notably RelaxNG and W3C Schema) for which an element that has text
          content may not be empty.</p></div><div class="note"><a id="Note159">159.</a><p><span id="id2581856"/>This method has been introduced in the markup literature under

          allow for some kind of validation, e.g. it can be prohibited that
          empty elements used as an end-tag have attributes normally given with
          a start tag. (see Bauman 2005) </p></div><div class="note"><a id="Note161">161.</a><p><span id="id2582036"/>Grammar based schema languages (e.g. DTD, W3C Schema, and RelaxNG)
          are used to define markup languages (e.g. XHTML or TEI). Rule-based
          schema languages (e.g. Schematron) can be used to define further
          constrains. Such a rule-based schema language permits a sequence of
          certain elements between empty elements to be legitimized or
          prohibited.</p></div></div><div class="stdfooter"><hr/><div class="footer"><a class="plain" href="http://www.tei-c.org/Consortium/">TEI Consortium</a> | <a class="plain" href="index.html">TEI P5</a> | <a class="plain" href="http://www.tei-c.org/Consortium/contact.xml">Feedback</a></div><hr/><address> edited by C.M.
