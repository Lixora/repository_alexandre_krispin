certainty =
  ## indicates the degree of certainty or uncertainty associated
  ##   with some aspect of the text markup. 
  element certainty { certainty.content, certainty.attributes }
certainty.content = macro.glossSeq
certainty.attributes =
  att.global.attributes,
  ## points at the elements whose markup is
  ##       uncertain.
  attribute target {
    list { data.pointer+ }
  },
  ## indicates the precise location of the uncertainty in the
  ##	markup: applicability of the element, precise position of the
  ##	start- or end-tag, value of a specific attribute,
  ##	etc.
  ## Suggested values include: 1] gi (uncertain whether the element used actually applies
  ##	    to the passage.); 2] startloc (start-tag may not be correctly located.); 3] endloc (end-tag may not be correctly located.); 4] location (both the start-tag and the end-tag may not be
  ##	    correctly located.); 5] att.name (the value given for the attribute name is
  ##	    uncertain.); 6] transcribedContent (the content of the element may not be a correct
  ##	    transcription of the source text.); 7] suppliedContent (the content of the element may not have been
  ##	    correctly supplied by the reader, e.g. as in the cases of
  ##	    corr and abbrev elements.)
  attribute locus { data.enumerated },
  ## provides an alternative value for the aspect of the markup in
  ## questionâ€”an alternative generic identifier, transcription,
  ## or attribute value, or the identifier of an anchor element (to
  ## indicate an alternative starting or ending location).  If an
  ## assertedValue is given, the confidence level specified by
  ## degree applies to the alternative markup specified by
  ## assertedValue; if none is given, it applies to the markup
  ## in the text.
  attribute assertedValue { data.pointer | data.name | data.word }?,
  ## indicates conditions assumed in the assignment of a degree
  ##       of confidence.
  attribute given {

  ## of the markup named by the locus attribute.

  ## markup of particular element(s).

  ## assigned.
  attribute target {

  ## indicates the specific aspect of the markup for which
  ## responsibility is being assigned.
  ## Suggested values include: 1] gi (responsibility for the claim that the element is of the
  ## type indicated by the markup); 2] location (responsibility for the claim that the element
  ## begins and ends where indicated); 3] startloc (responsibility for the claim that the element
  ## begins where indicated); 4] endloc (responsibility for the claim that the element
  ## ends where indicated); 5] att.name (responsibility for the claim that the
  ## name attribute has the value given in the markup); 6] transcribedContent (responsibility for the transcription of
  ## the element content); 7] suppliedContent (responsibility for the contents supplied by
  ## the encoder (corrections, expansions of abbreviations, etc.))
  attribute locus { data.enumerated },
