* Wish-list

** Longlines
It would be nice to turn on longlines-mode, but it would need at a
minimum to support the indentation of text in AucTeX and nxml-mode.

** Previewing pdf files in acroread
Include pdfopen/pdfclose for Windows, and xpdfopen for X.
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/xpdfopen/xpdfopen.pdf

** eshell: can we keep point out of prompt?
set eshell-prompt-face to intangible?

** C-f5 should skip up over blank lines to the nearest text

** Make a function for buffer-stack-show-position:
that shows a single line at the bottom of the screen with the current
buffer highlighted in the middle

** Line-mode editing à la Vim's "V"
** Write a function to break a paragraph into sentences.  Obey fill-prefix

** Write a visible, anonymous bookmark package
anon-bkmk.el -- some notes

** Nice way to change font-size
Probably needs to wait until xft-backend is in use

** Web page -- Hints for using easymacs-grep
-R for recursive: give directory as argument
-i for case-insensitive

** Web page on using Easymacs with TEI docs
e.g. how to associate a file with a schema



* Nice to have:

** xslt-process: broken?
** docbook stuff
