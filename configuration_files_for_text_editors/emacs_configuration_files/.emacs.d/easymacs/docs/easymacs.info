Easymacs is an easy to learn configuration for Emacs.

Here is a quick survival guide:

     New file: Ctrl-N    | Open file: Ctrl-O   | Save file: Ctrl-S
     Close file: Ctrl-W  | Exit Emacs: Alt-F4  | Interrupt: Escape
     Undo: Ctrl-Z        | Show open files: F9 | Browse menus: F10
     Switch to next open file: Ctrl-Tab

*NB* You can hit Alt-Shift-F1 to get back to this page.

Using Emacs
***********

Here are some general observations about the behavior of Emacs that
may seem odd to the new user:

   * If you use a keyboard command to do something (such as <F1> to
     open a file), you will usually be prompted at the bottom of the
     screen, whereas if you use the mouse to select that same command
     from a menu, you may be presented with a dialog box instead.
     This is deliberate.

   * If you are entering text at the prompt at the bottom of the
     screen, the <Tab> key will often help you to complete a
     partially-typed answer.  If you have no idea what answer to
     give, hit <Tab> right away to get a list of the expected
     responses.

The Macintosh Keyboard
**********************

Use Apple-F14, Ctrl-F14, or Alt-x easymacs-mac-swap-modifiers to
switch between Mac-style and PC-style modifier keys.

   In Mac-style, you can use the Apple ("command") key for Easymacs
Ctrl and the key marked Ctrl for Easymacs Alt.  In PC-style, use the
Apple key for Easymacs Alt and the Ctrl key for Control.

   There are a number of Function key combinations that are normally
reserved by the operating system, but you can still send these to
Easymacs by combining them with the "option" key (marked with "alt"
and a broken line).  Alternatively, you can configure OS X not to use
these combinations (System Preferences -> Keyboard & Mouse -> Keyboard
Shortcuts).  The combinations likely to be a problem are: Ctrl-F1,
Apple-F5, Ctrl-F7, Ctrl-Shift-F7, Ctrl-F8, F9, Shift-F9, F10,
Shift-F10, F11, Shift-F11, F12, Shift-F12.

   If you inadvertently switch on "accessibility mode" by hitting
Ctrl-F1, even more function keys will be affected; switch it off by
hitting Ctrl-F1 again, or via the Preferences pane.

                              to give it a name, so that Emacs will
                              know what sort of file it is, and will be
                              able to give you the help appropriate for
                              that sort of file.

                              term).  As you type letters, you can see
                              the progress of the search.  If you find
                              what you are looking for, hit Return to

Insertion and Deletion
**********************

The most important keys for inserting and deleting text are Ctrl-C
(copy), Ctrl-X (cut), Ctrl-V (paste), explained above, and you can
also use Shft-Delete for cut, Shft-Insert for paste, and Ctrl-Insert
for copy.

The Insert key switches from insert to overwrite mode; the status bar
at the bottom of the screen shows "Ovwrt" in overwrite mode.

Here are some other keys:

Key            Command        Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ctrl-Backspace Delete Word    Ctrl with Backspace deletes a word
                              backwards.

               Clipboard      bits of text you have put in the
               History        clipboard.  So use Ctrl-V to paste the
                              current contents of the clipboard, but
                              Ctrl-Shft-V to view the history of past
                              contents of the clipboard; then hit
                              Return to select the bit you want to
                              paste.

                              typed, even if it is a control character.

                              and it uses a different vocabulary to
                              describe things.

F3             Search Word    Search forward for the word under the
                              cursor.  If you are already doing a
                              search, F3 will repeat the search forward.

Shft-F3        Search Word    As above, but backward through the file.
               Backward       

Alt-F3         Replace Regexp Search for a regular expression and
                              replace it forward from the cursor
                              position to the end of the file, or if
                              text is selected, within the selected
                              text; do not ask for confirmation.

Shft-Alt-F3    Confirm        As above, but ask for confirmation before

                              and so on.  This is very handy when you

                              typing on for a bit, since you don't have

Commands for Specific File-types (F10-F12)
******************************************

With the exception of unmodified F10, function keys F10-F12 are mostly
reserved for functions that are specific to the particular type of
file being edited.  If nothing else is defined for a particular
file-type, the default is that F12 compiles and F11 runs.  Note also
that for some types of files, Shft-F1 produces context-sensitive help.

F10 on its own is the key that allows you to navigate the menus with
the keyboard; but note that this does not yet work under GTK for
GNU/Linux.

Here are the file-types for which there are special keys:

* Menu:

* LaTeX files::
* XML files::
* Directory listings::

                              type it twice).  But if you paste some
                              text in from a non-LaTeX document, you
                              may need to correct the quotes in it.
                              This function changes straight quotes to
                              smart ones from the cursor forward, or
                              within the currently selected text.

In a LaTeX file, the grep command (Shft-Ctrl-F9) runs by default not
on the current directory, but only on those files that comprise the
current document.

                              pressing this key while inside such a
                              block will hide the rest of the file, and
                              show you just that block with proper
                              coloring, indentation help, etc. for that
                              language.  Hit the same key again, and

                              suggest running one of the TEI
                              stylesheets for conversion to HTML, LaTeX
                              or FO.

Numeric Keypad
**************

For those of us who rarely have to enter many numbers into text files,
the numeric keypad is a bit of a waste.  The keyboard shortcuts in
this section are not enabled by default; you must use the Pause key
to turn them on.  Below, KP- stands for "Keypad".

Key            Command        Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Pause          Toggle keypad  Switch between using the numeric keypad
                              for math, and for the convenience
                              commands listed below.  Your current
                              preference is stored for future sessions.
                              Shft-Pause will show the current status.
KP-Enter       Save           Save the current file (same as Ctrl-S).

KP-Plus        Find           Search forward (same as Ctrl-F).

KP-Minus       Find Backward  Search backward (same as Shft-Ctrl-F).

KP-.           Toggle accents Turn on and off a special way of
                              inserting characters not present on your
                              keyboard.  When this mode is enabled, for
                              example, "u produces u-umlaut, 'e
                              produces e-acute, ~!  produces the
                              upside-down exclamation mark, /o gives o
                              with a diagonal stroke, and so forth.
                              Your operating or windowing system may
                              also provide another way of entering such
                              characters.

Shft-KP-.      Unsafe Char    After pasting in text from somewhere
                              else, there may be characters that cannot
                              be represented correctly in the encoding
                              of the current file.  Instead of
                              presenting gibberish, Emacs complains
                              when you try to save the file.  This
                              command moves to the next character that
                              does not fit in the current encoding.

Ctrl-KP-.      Insert char    Insert literally the next character
                              typed, even if it is a control character.

Alt-KP-.       Repeat         Repeat the last command, which may have
                              been complex, such as a search and
                              replace.

KP-0           Wrap Paragraph A shortcut for Alt-q, which re-wraps and
                              re-indents the current paragraph.

Alt-KP-0       Show Blanks    Make whitespace visible (toggle).

Ctrl-KP-0      Line Numbers   Show line numbers (toggle).

KP-8, 2        Scroll Text    The 8 or 2 keys on the keypad (which
                              often have up and down arrows on them)
                              arrows scrolls the text up or down,
                              relative to the cursor, by one line.

                              often have right and left arrows on them)
                              circulate through the list of open files
                              in either direction (like Ctrl-Tab and
                              Ctrl-Shft-Tab).

KP-5           Show position  If you want to cycle through the open
                              files with KP-4 and 6, but don't know
                              which direction to head in to find the
                              file you want, this will display the next
                              and previous files at the bottom of the
                              screen.

KP-7, 1        Start/End of   The 7 or 1 keys on the keypad (which
               file           often have Home and End on them) go to
                              the start and end of the current file
                              (like Ctrl-Home/End).

KP-9, 3        Top/Bottom of  The 9 or 3 keys on the keypad (which
               screen         often have PgUp and PgDown on them) go to
                              the top and bottom of the screen (like
                              Ctrl-PgUp/PgDown).

Alt-KP-        Align Columns  Align the selected text into
                              minimally-separated columns, as defined
                              by whitespace.

Alt-KP-+       Align Columns  As above, but do not minimize whitespace.

KP-*           Toggle Case    Invert the case of the current letter,
                              and move to the next (like Ctrl-E).

Shft-KP-*      Toggle Case    As above, but moving backwards (like
                              Ctrl-Shift-E).

Shft-KP-/      Bounce Paren   If on a parenthesis or brace, move to the
                              matching one (like Ctrl-/).

Selecting Rectangles
====================

There are advanced facilities available for selecting columns of text,
or arbitrary rectangles, and working with them, but this section will
only give a quick introduction.

   Ctrl-Return turns rectangle mode on and off again; one you start
it, you can extend the selection by moving the cursor.  The cut and
copy commands work as you would expect.

   To insert the same text in a whole series of lines, select a
column and type the text.
